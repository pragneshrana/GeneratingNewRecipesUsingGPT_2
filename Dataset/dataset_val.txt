 
 Ingredients: 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1 onion, diced 
 1 carrot, peeled and diced 
 1 celery rib, washed and diced 
 4 ears corn, husked and kernels removed 
 6 baby red new potatoes, unpeeled, washed and diced 
 1 quart clam juice 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 3 1/2 pounds Littleneck clams, Manila clams or Cockles in the shell 
 1 Italian Roma tomato, cored, seeded and diced 
 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and diced 
 1 jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded, if desired 
 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped 
 Juice of 1 lime 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 Salt to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Melt the butter in a large stockpot over moderate heat. Saute the onions for 10 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, corn and potatoes and saute 2 minutes longer. Pour in the clam juice. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the white wine to a boil in a large saucepan and reduce by one-third. Add the clams, cover and steam, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams open up, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard any that do not open. Remove the cover and let the clams cool in the pot. When cool enough to handle, separate the meat from the shells, reserving the juice, and chop the clams. Set aside. Reserve the cooking liquid. Add the tomato, red pepper and jalapeno to the soup pot and cook over low heat an additional 10 minutes. Strain the reserved cooking juices and clam juice through a fine kitchen towel or coffee filter into the soup. Add the chopped clams and cook 10 more minutes. Stir in the cilantro, lime juice and pepper. Taste for salt, since the clams may be salty, and serve steaming hot. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (9-pound) boneless pork shoulder, skin trimmed 
 8 cloves garlic, smashed 
 2 to 3 cups vegetable stock 
 1/2 cup seafood boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 
 1 tablespoon onion powder 
 1 tablespoon garlic powder 
 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Sunny's Pork Sauce, recipe follows 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 1 cup chopped Vidalia onion 
 2 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 cups ketchup 
 1 cup apple cider vinegar 
 1/2 cup orange juice 
 1/4 cup Sriracha 
 2 to 3 tablespoons brown sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Heat the oven to 250 degrees F. With the tip of a knife, make 8 (2-inch) pockets all around the pork and insert a smashed garlic clove in each. In a small bowl, combine the seafood boil seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Rub the seasoning all over the pork then let rest at room temperature up to 2 hours. Place the pork in the bottom of a roasting pan and add enough vegetable stock to fill it to an inch deep. Cover very tightly with several layers of aluminum foil, getting the seal tight is really key here. The steam being locked in breaks down the pork to make it pull-worthy. Roast the pork, covered, in the oven for 2 hours then pull back the aluminum foil a bit and prick with a fork. If it is tender, remove the aluminum foil and a place back in the oven for 1 more hour. If it isn't tender yet, cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, making sure to add more stock if needed. Once tender remove the aluminum foil all together. If the liquid evaporates here, it's ok; it has done its job. Remove from oven then let rest at room temperature, then chop down to small chunks and mix with enough of Sunny's Pork Sauce, recipe follows to make it wet or dry to your taste. In a saucepot on medium-low heat, add the oil. Add the onions, garlic, and season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook until both are tender, but not browned and then add the ketchup, vinegar, orange juice, and Sriracha. Taste and then add the sugar, to taste. This should be a loose sauce. Refrigerate or use right away. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 teaspoon instant coffee 
 3/4 cup plum sauce 
 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 
 2 tablespoons minced chipotle in adobo with sauce 
 2 tablespoons brown sugar 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 1/2 pounds pork back ribs 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix 1/4 cup hot water with the instant coffee and stir to dissolve. Once, dissolved, combine with the plum sauce, orange juice, chipotle sauce and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring the sauce to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Coat both sides of the ribs with the sauce, saving 2/3 cup for basting. Arrange the ribs, meaty-side up, in 1 layer in a foil-lined baking sheet. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake the ribs 1 hour. Remove the foil (from the top), baste with the remaining BBQ sauce and bake the ribs 1 hour more. Allow the cooked ribs to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups cooked wild rice 
 1 cup grated carrots (from 2 to 3 carrots) 
 3 green onions, finely chopped 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 
 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 Pepper 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 eggs, lightly beaten 
 Vegetable oil, for frying

Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil as necessary. Serve hot. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 
 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 3 eggs 
 1/2 cup persimmon pulp 
 1/2 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/2 lemon, juiced 
 1/4 cup water 
 1/4 cup heavy cream 
 1/4 cup blossom or wildflower honey 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar with cinnamon, coriander, and nutmeg. Using an electric mixer at moderate speed, being mixing, adding the eggs one by one. Then add the persimmon pulp until the mixture holds together. Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, and lemon juice, and mix until the batter is smooth. Set aside. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the remaining 3/4 cups of sugar with water and cook over medium heat until the mixture caramelizes, about 10 minutes. When the sugar has caramelized, immediately remove from the heat to stop cooking. Assemble four (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Wearing an oven mitt on the hand that holds the saucepan, carefully pour a little caramel into the bottom of each ramekin. Then pour about 1/3 cup of persimmon batter on top of the caramel. Set the prepared ramekins in a deep-sided baking dish and pour enough water around them to reach halfway up the sides. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the flans are set. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Refrigerate each flan, covered with plastic wrap, to set. Just before serving, whip the cream in a medium bowl until it forms soft peaks. Blend in the honey, then whip again. Set aside. Remove the flans from the refrigerator and run a small paring knife around the rim of each. Hold a dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and invert so that the flan and caramel are positioned in the center of each plate. Place a dollop of honeyed whipped cream on each portion and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 12 ounces dried chickpeas (about 2 cups) 
 2 teaspoons baking soda 
 1 cup packed fresh parsley leaves (about 1 bunch) 
 3/4 cup tahini 
 Zest of 1 lemon and juice of 2 lemons (about 1/3 cup juice) 
 2 cloves garlic 
 Kosher salt 
 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
 Warm pita wedges, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Cover the chickpeas with 4 cups water in a large pot with 1 teaspoon baking soda and refrigerate 8 hours or up to overnight to soak. Strain the chickpeas and discard the soaking liquid. Rinse the chickpeas and return them to the pot. Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and water to cover by about 3 inches over the chickpeas. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Cook the chickpeas until tender but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove 1 cup of chickpeas from the pot with a slotted spoon. Drain well and reserve on a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Continue cooking the remaining chickpeas until they are mostly intact and soft and creamy (not crumbly) when pressed between a thumb and forefinger, about 10 minutes more. If the liquid boils off too much while cooking, add more water to cover and continue to cook. Meanwhile, make the parsley oil. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the parsley leaves and cook 10 seconds, then drain. Immediately run the parsley under very cold water to cool it completely, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze out the excess liquid and then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to dry. When the chickpeas are done cooking, strain them and discard the liquid. Let the chickpeas sit in the strainer to drain and dry out for 5 minutes. Put the chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and process until the mixture is a paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the ice water and continue to process, adding more water by the tablespoon as necessary, until the mixture is smooth and light, about 5 minutes. The hummus should be slightly loose because it will firm up as it sits. Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and cover by lightly pressing plastic wrap directly onto the surface; set aside until ready to serve. (The hummus can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.) Put the cooked parsley leaves in a blender along with 1/2 cup olive oil and puree until the parsley is fine and the oil green, about 5 minutes. Transfer the parsley oil to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Parsley oil can be used right away, or held at room temperature up to 6 hours Just before serving, fry the chickpeas. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Pat the reserved chickpeas dry with a clean towel and carefully add them to the skillet. (The oil will bubble up for a few seconds.) Fry, shaking the pan occasionally, until browned and crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer the chickpeas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Immediately sprinkle with the lemon zest, cayenne, cumin and some salt; toss to coat. Remove the plastic wrap from the reserved hummus. Make a shallow circular indentation with the back of a spoon in the center of the hummus. Mound the fried chickpeas in the center of the hummus. Drizzle with the parsley oil, spooning most of it around the edges of the hummus. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 slices stone-milled rye artisan bread, about 1/2-inch thick 
 5 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
 1/4 cup store-bought apple butter 
 1 pound sliced fresh roasted deli turkey 
 1/2 pound brie cheese, thickly sliced 
 1 bunch arugula, stems trimmed

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds frozen green peas 
 4 tablespoons butter 
 2 (14.5-ounce) cans reduced sodium chicken or vegetable broth 
 2 medium onions, roughly chopped 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup sour cream, for garnish 
 1 demi-baguette (or 1/2 of 1 French baguette), cut into 8 (1/2-inch) thick slices 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a medium pot, combine peas, butter, broth, and onions. If the peas are not submerged in liquid, add just enough water to cover them. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for about 7 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are soft enough to puree and the peas are still bright green. While the peas are cooking, grill the bread. Heat a grill pan over high heat for 3 minutes. Pour some olive oil onto a large plate. Sprinkle oil with salt then dip pieces of bread quickly on both sides into the oil. Grill bread until slightly charred and hot, about 3 minutes per side. Using an immersion blender, standing blender*, or food processor, puree the soup until smooth and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Serve each bowl with a dollop of sour cream on top and grilled bread on the side. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. <|endoftext|>

 2 lemons, sliced 
 1 small bulb fennel, sliced 
 Olive oil, for drizzling 
 1/4 cup dry white wine 
 Instructions: 
 Heat a grill to medium high. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and place each on a double rectangle of foil. Top with the arugula, half the lemon slices and the fennel. Sprinkle the outside of the fish with salt and pepper, drizzle lightly with olive oil and splash each with some wine. Enclose each fish in the foil, sealing to make a packet. Wrap each fish one more time with foil. Place the foil packets on the grill and cook for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the skin and fillet the fish from the bones. Serve on a platter with the remaining lemon slices. Garnish with the arugula and fennel. Squeeze a little lemon juice on top of the fish, just enough to taste. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup whole, 2 percent or skim milk 
 1 or 2 shots hot espresso per latte (depending on your preference) 
 2 tablespoons Pumpkin Spice Syrup, recipe follows 
 Cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice, for garnish, optional 
 1/3 cup pumpkin puree 
 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 1/2 cup light brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a milk frother Bring the milk to a simmer over low heat. Froth the milk using a milk frother or a whisk. Combine the espresso shots and a tablespoon of Pumpkin Spice Syrup in 2 large coffee mugs and stir half of the milk into each. Sprinkle the tops with spice, if desired. Drink immediately! Combine the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the mixture thickens slightly and the spices become fragrant, about 3 minutes. Combine 2 cups cold water and the granulated and brown sugars in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture thickens and reduces slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in the spiced pumpkin puree and cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil after you add the pumpkin or the syrup will become cloudy (even after straining.) Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes. Place a mesh strainer over a medium bowl and line the strainer with several layers of cheesecloth. Pour the mixture through the strainer and let it strain slowly into the bowl. Add the vanilla extract to the syrup and transfer to a container with a tight fitting lid. The syrup will last 1 month stored in the refrigerator. Makes about 1 1/2 cups; leftovers can be refrigerated for 1 week. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup beef broth 
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
 1 pound ground pork 
 1 pound ground turkey 
 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs 
 2 large eggs 
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice 
 1 teaspoon onion powder 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup sour cream 
 1 tablespoon lingonberry or red currant jelly, optional 
 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped 
 Instructions: 
 Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce to a 6-quart slow cooker. Add the pork, turkey, breadcrumbs, eggs, allspice, onion powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large bowl. Mix the meat with your hands until the mixture is uniform in color and texture. Scoop level tablespoonfuls, and roll them into balls; place them in a single layer in the slow cooker. When the bottom of the cooker is covered, add a second layer, starting on the outer edge. (The outside of the cooker is hotter; meatballs on the edge will cook more quickly than those in the center.) Cover and cook on high for 2 hours, until the meatballs are cooked through. Meanwhile, rub the butter and flour together in a small bowl to make a smooth paste (which will be used to thicken the sauce). Pinch off 1/2-inch balls, and set on a small plate. Transfer the meatballs with a slotted spoon from the slow cooker to a large bowl, leaving the cooking liquid in the pot. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups liquid.) When removing the meatballs, start from the outer edges and scoop carefully. Some may be stuck together; gentle coaxing with the spoon will separate them. Whisk the butter-flour paste into the cooking liquid, 1 or 2 balls at a time, to incorporate. Whisk in the sour cream and jelly, if using. Return the meatballs to the slow cooker, and stir with the spoon to coat. Cook on high, uncovered, until the sauce is thickened, 30 minutes. Adjust the setting to keep warm, sprinkle the meatballs with the parsley and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 7 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped 
 1 small can, 250 grams, Chestnut Cream or Sweetened Chestnut Puree 
 1/3 cup rum 
 Buttercream, recipe follows 
 1 Genoise sheet cake, baked 
 Meringue Mushrooms, recipe follows 
 Sprigs of fresh Pine or Holly 
 Instructions: 
 Place chocolate in a small bowl with 1/4 cup water. Set bowl in a pan of barely simmering water, stirring frequently until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool. Combine 1/2 cup, or more to taste, of chestnut cream into 1 slightly rounded cup of buttercream. Set aside. Assemble the Buche: Peel parchment liner from cake. Lift foil under cake and invert it onto a second sheet of foil. Remove the original foil, peeling away the browned genoise "skin" stuck to it. Moisten the cake with the rum, using a pastry brush. Spread chestnut buttercream evenly over the cake. Roll the cake tightly, the long way, into a "log" using the foil to aid you if necessary. Wrap log tightly in foil. Freeze until hard, or at least firm. The firmer the cake, the easier it will be to decorate. Log may be completed to this point, and kept frozen, up to 6 weeks. Stir chocolate mixture into remaining buttercream and refrigerate or freeze until needed. Finish and Decorate the Buche: Soften reserved chocolate buttercream and beat just until smooth. Unwrap the frozen log. Trim a fraction of an inch from each end to even the edges. Spread the log with most of the reserved chocolate buttercream. Do not frost the ends. Use a fork to texture the buttercream so that it resembles the bark of a tree. Dip a sharp knife in hot water, then wipe dry. Cut the diagonal "stump" off each end of the log. Set stumps aside. Transfer log to a serving platter. Affix stumps to the log. Cover bare spots with buttercream. Use the fork to touch up the bark effect as necessary. Decorate with sprigs of pine and meringue mushrooms. Store in the refrigerator. For best flavor and texture, remove Buche from the refrigerator at least an hour before serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Shortcrust Pastry, recipe follows 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 6 ounces streaky bacon, cut into 1/2-inch lardons 
 4 ounces onions, peeled and chopped 
 2 eggs and 2 egg yokes 
 9 ounces heavy cream 
 1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley leaves 
 1 tablespoon freshly chopped chives 
 2 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated 
 2 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 7 ounces all-purpose flour, sifted 
 Pinch of salt 
 7 tablespoons chilled butter, cubed 
 1/2 to 1 medium egg, beaten 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: 7 1/2-inch high-sided tart pan or 9-inch shallow quiche plate Make the Shortcrust pastry, recipe below, leaving to chill for 30 minutes before using. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the tart pan with the pastry dough, and bake 'blind'. Filling: Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the bacon until crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. Then sweat the onions gently in the same oil for 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs in a medium-sized bowl, add the cream, parsley and chives, cheeses, and cool bacon and onions. Mix well and add seasoning. Pour the filling into the pastry base and return to the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the center has set. Serve warm with a green salad and relish. Put the flour, salt, and butter in a food processor and whiz or pulse briefly. Add half the beaten egg and continue to whiz. You might add a little more egg, but not too much as the mixture should be just moist enough to come together. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. Then, using your hands, add just enough egg to bring the dough together. With your hands, flatten out the ball of dough, until it is about 3/4-inch thick, and then wrap in plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag and leave in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or, if you are pushed for time, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 1 crust (about 14 ounces). <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 10 ounces raw boneless skinless lean chicken breast, cut into 8 strips 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons honey mustard, plus more, for optional dipping 
 1/4 cup fat-free liquid egg substitute 
 20 standard-sized (not mini) hard salted thin pretzel twists 
 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season chicken strips with salt and pepper. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine honey mustard with egg substitute and whisk well. Submerge the chicken and set aside to marinate for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place pretzels in sealable plastic bag, seal, and finely crush through the bag with a meat mallet or other heavy utensil. Add sugar, reseal, and shake to mix. Spread the mixture out on a large plate or in a large dish. Set aside. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Using tongs, transfer chicken strips to the pretzel-sugar mixture and thoroughly coat. Then transfer them to the baking sheet. (Discard excess mustard-egg mixture.) Mist the tops of the strips with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through baking, until the chicken is cooked through. Eat and enjoy! <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (3 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for preparing the pan 
 2 1/4 cups sugar 
 3 cups cake flour, sifted, plus more for preparing the pans 
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 
 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, at room temperature 
 6 large egg whites, room temperature 
 About 4 to 6 cups VANILLA FROSTING or CHOCOLATE FROSTING, recipes follow 
 Food coloring (optional) 
 Enough candles to equal the age of the birthday celebrant 
 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 4 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk, at room temperature 
 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 
 1 pound semi-sweet chocolate, roughly chopped 
 1 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 1/3 cup dark corn syrup, plus more to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Lightly butter and flour two 9 x 1 1/2-inch round cake pans. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter at low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Slowly add the sugar and mix until just incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Meanwhile, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk and vanilla. Reduce the mixer's speed to low. Alternately add the flour mixture and milk mixture, waiting for each to be fully incorporated before adding the next (scrape the bowl down occasionally). Raise the speed to medium and mix briefly until a smooth batter is formed. Transfer the batter to a large bowl. Thoroughly clean the bowl of the mixer and place the egg whites inside. Using the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on high speed, until stiff peaks are formed. Working in 3 batches, using a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the batter, until just incorporated. Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Place the pans on the middle oven rack evenly spaced apart. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. Let cool completely. Frost the cake. Place one layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand. (If using the vanilla frosting, reserve about 1 to 2 cups for coloring and decorating.) Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread about half of the frosting all over the cake. (Spread enough frosting over the top to make a 1/4-to-1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set the other layer on top, rounded-side up, and spread all over with the remaining frosting. If coloring the vanilla frosting, place the reserved frosting in a medium bowl and stir in the food coloring, little by little, until the desired color is reached. Transfer the colored frosting to a pastry bag with small, round or fluted tip, or a plastic baggie with a small portion of a corner cut off. Using the colored frosting, creatively write "Happy Birthday" to whomever and decorate the edges in fringes and whirls, if desired. Serve immediately with lit candles or store at room temperature or in the refrigerator covered with a cake or pie lid. (If storing the cake in the refrigerator, remember to remove it several hours before serving, to bring it to room temperature.) In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer, combine the butter and sugar and mix on low until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the milk, vanilla, lemon juice, and zest. Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the milk mixture in 3 batches, waiting for each batch to be fully incorporated before adding the next (scrape the bowl down occasionally). Raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy. Use as desired. May be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 3 days. Yield: about 6 cups Put the chocolate in a large bowl and set aside. In a small saucepan, whisk together the cream and corn syrup and bring to a boil. Pour the cream mixture over the bowl of chocolate and immediately whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool completely, about 1 hour. Transfer the chocolate mixture to the bowl of a standing electric mixer, or with a hand-held mixer and whip on high speed until creamy and fluffy. Use as desired. May be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Yield: about 4 cups Copyright 2001 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 large Russet potatoes, well scrubbed 
 24 ounces vegetable, canola, or peanut oil 
 Sea salt and malt vinegar 
 Crab boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 
 Truffle oil 
 Parsley 
 Freshly chopped garlic 
 Hot sauce 
 Grated Parmesan 
 Red chile flakes 
 Fresh herbs 
 Instructions: 
 Leaving the skin on, cut the potatoes into long thin strips and put in a large bowl of clean water to remove some starch, prevent them from sticking together, and stop the oxidizing process. In a cast iron skillet fitted with a thermometer, or a small fryer, heat the oil until it reaches 275 to 300 degrees F. Remove the potatoes from the water and pat dry. Working in small batches, fry the potatoes until they go from shiny to matte, 3 to 5 minutes (this is also called blanching). Drain well on paper towels. Re-heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees F and fry the potatoes again, also in small batches, until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. Remove from the oil, drain well, and toss with sea salt and malt vinegar, or any other seasoning you prefer. You can also fry fresh herbs such as rosemary, sage, and thyme with the potatoes. Serve hot. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 6 large potatoes, cut in pieces 
 2 medium onions, chopped 
 6 stalks celery, chopped small 
 Enough vegetable oil for saute 
 8-10 pieces of old bread, broken into bite-size pieces 
 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk 
 4 raw eggs, beaten 
 Salt and pepper 
 4-5 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped fine 
 1-2 tablespoons poultry seasoning 
 Stock from the giblets and neck 
 1/2 stick of butter, cut into pieces 
 Instructions: 
 Boil potatoes in salted water. Saute onion and celery in oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Boil the giblets and neck in salted water to make stock. Moisten bread with milk. Smash the potatoes in a large bowl. (I use a small roasting pan, and then I roast the filling right in it.) Add all other ingredients including all spices and oil from saute. When adding the eggs, add a little of the hot mixture to the eggs first and beat well, so as to not scramble them when they go into the whole mix. Mix thoroughly. If it needs more moisture, add the stock, a little at a time. Taste to make sure enough spices are added. Add more salt and pepper and poultry seasoning, if needed. Bake at 350 degrees in a greased casserole dish or roasting pan until very hot and browned, usually one hour. Dot the top with pats of butter before putting into oven. I know some people chop the giblets and add to the filling, but I don't. <|endoftext|>

 2 cups chicken stock 
 3/4 cup loosely packed tender sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) 
 12 ounces chorizo, cut into bite-size pieces 
 2 small or 1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise, seeded and chopped 
 1 onion, chopped 
 1/3 recipe Roasted Garlic Paste, recipe follows (or 2 heads roasted garlic) 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for serving 
 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 
 2 to 3 tablespoons seeded pureed chipotles in adobo sauce 
 One 14-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 
 One 14-ounce can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained 
 One 14-ounce can crushed or diced fire-roasted tomatoes or diced tomatoes with green chilies 
 4 tablespoons butter 
 2 large corn muffins 
 Seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 
 Shaved Manchego cheese, for serving 
 6 heads garlic, tops trimmed off to expose all of the cloves 
 1 cup EVOO 
 3 tablespoons honey 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Roast the bell pepper over a gas flame, turning with tongs, or broil until the skin is blackened. Transfer to a bowl, cover and let cool. Peel, seed and chop the pepper. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the butternut squash on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle lightly with EVOO, sprinkle with the nutmeg and cinnamon and season with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and browned at the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep the oven on. Meanwhile, combine the stock and sun-dried tomatoes in a small saucepan. Bring to a low simmer over medium heat and cook until very tender. Heat 1 tablespoon EVOO in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until browned. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add the zucchini to the pot and cook until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the onions and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes, then add the roasted peppers. Pour the sun-dried tomatoes and the cooking liquid into a food processor and add the Roasted Garlic Paste, cilantro, oregano and chipotle puree. Puree until smooth, then add the mixture to the chili and stir to combine. Add the beans, canned tomatoes, chorizo and roasted squash. Add enough water to thin the chili to the desired consistency. Melt the butter in a small pan. Coarsely crumble the muffins on a baking sheet, then drizzle with the melted butter and sprinkle with seafood seasoning. Bake until browned. Ladle the chili into shallow bowls and top with the Manchego cheese and crumbled muffins. The chili can be covered and refrigerated for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Arrange the garlic in a cluster on a large piece of foil and drizzle with 1/4 cup EVOO. Wrap up the garlic in the foil to make a tightly sealed pouch. Roast until very tender, about 45 minutes. Let cool, then squeeze the garlic from the skins into a food processor. Add the remaining 3/4 cup EVOO and the honey and season with salt and pepper. Puree until smooth, then transfer to a small container. (Alternatively, you can mash the garlic paste with a fork instead of using a food processor.) <|endoftext|>

 Use a separate cutting board for prepping and place a nice wooden board for the display in front of you. Unwrap all the meats and cheeses and lay them out next to your display board. Place the baby mozzarella in a small dish and set on 1 corner of the board. Roll the prosciutto like a burrito, fold the mortadella in half 2 or 3 times, and wrap the cappicolla into a horn shape and place it creatively on the cutting board. (There is no set way to roll the meats, just go with the way the meat is cut). Slice a bit of each cheese, the soppressata, and pepperoni and place on board in between folded meats. Scatter board with artichoke hearts, olives, pepperoncinis, and roasted red peppers. To finish, take a few basil leaves sliced chiffonade-style and mix with the minced garlic and olive oil. Drizzle over the entire board. Garnish with whole basil leaves and serve with cucumber slices as an alternative to crackers. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Olive oil 
 4 pounds swordfish, center eye loin 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 pound prosciutto slices 
 8 fresh thyme sprigs 
 2 oranges 
 1/4 cup golden raisins 
 2 fennel bulbs 
 1/2 cup whole Kalamata black olives, pitted 
 6 anchovy fillets, chopped 
 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 10 fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade 
 1 tablespoon fennel seed 
 1/4 pound arugula 
 6 cherry tomatoes, halved 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil the swordfish all over and season generously with salt and pepper. Lay 15 pieces of prosciutto out flat on waxed paper, overlapping a bit, and place the swordfish loin on top. Roll the prosciutto around the circumference of the fish, to wrap it. Remove the waxed paper. Secure the swordfish ?roast? with butcher?s twine. Thread the thyme sprigs under the pieces of string. Coat a roasting pan with olive oil and set on 2 burners over high heat until almost smoking. Sear the swordfish on all sides until the prosciutto begins to crisp up, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the fish is opaque and feels springy-firm when poked. Using a paring knife, peel the oranges, removing all the white pith. Place a mixing bowl under the orange to catch the juice and cut between the membranes to release the segments; add to the bowl. Add the raisins to the oranges so they plump while preparing the rest of the dish. Trim the stalks from the fennel bulbs, reserving the fronds for garnish, and remove tough outer leaves. Cut the bulb in half lengthwise, trim the base, and cut out the core. Slice fennel into strips as thin as possible. Put the fennel slices in the bowl and add the olives, anchovies, vinegar, oil, basil, and fennel seeds. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper; toss gently to mix. To serve, spoon the fennel salad down the length of a serving platter. Remove twine from the swordfish and slice into 1 1/2-inch steaks, lay the swordfish in the center, and drizzle platter with olive oil. Garnish with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and reserved fennel tops. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 lemon 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
 1 tablespoon freshly chopped rosemary leaves, plus sprigs for garnish 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper 
 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 
 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, chopped 
 1/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and coarsely chopped 
 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked pepper 
 1 rack of lamb (about 8 chops) 
 Instructions: 
 To make the Marinade: Zest the lemon with a fine grater, taking care to only remove the yellow peel¿the white pith beneath it is bitter. Use the lemon juice for cocktails, or splash a bit into the marinade if you really love citrus. Mix all the marinade ingredients together. To make the Stuffing: Mix the stuffing ingredients together. To prepare the Lamb: Cut the rack in 1/2 crosswise so that each piece contains 4 chops. Insert a long, skinny knife into 1 end of the meat and push it through until the tip emerges from the other end. Then, remove the knife and use the handle of a wooden spoon to ream out a 1/2-inch hole, forming a tube through the 4 chops. With your fingers, press half the stuffing into the rack, making sure it's distributed evenly. Repeat with the other half of lamb. Place the lamb in a zipper baggie, spoon the marinade onto the meat, and rub it in a little bit. Marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roast the chops for 25 minutes for medium rare, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 135 degrees F. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes (during which they continue cooking, and the juices run back to the center). Slice into individual chops, if you like, fan across the plate, garnish with a rosemary sprig, and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
 3 tablespoons ice water 
 3 tablespoons cold vodka 
 3 pounds assorted apples (such as Cortland, Granny Smith and McIntosh) 
 Juice of 1 lemon 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1 cup jarred cherries in syrup or whole cherry jam 
 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
 1/4 teaspoon pure almond or vanilla extract 
 Pinch of allspice 
 1 large egg, lightly beaten 
 Coarse sugar, for sprinkling 
 Instructions: 
 Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add one-quarter of the butter; process until it disappears into the flour, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal with bean-size bits of butter. Combine the water and vodka and drizzle over the flour mixture. Pulse until the dough just starts coming together but stop before it gathers into a ball. Divide evenly between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pat each into a disk, using the plastic wrap to help you. (If the dough seems dry with large bits of butter, turn it out onto a work surface and use the heel of your hand to press the dough together.) Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Make the filling: Peel and thinly slice the apples; toss in a bowl with the lemon juice. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the apples and cook, tossing occasionally, until juicy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; fold in the cherries, flour, extract and allspice. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate; refrigerate until ready to fill. Place a piece of parchment paper on an inverted baking sheet. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round, transfer to the parchment and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Transfer the dough (on the parchment) to a work surface. Using a fluted pastry wheel or a chef's knife, cut the dough into 14 to 16 half-inch-wide strips. Weave into a lattice on the parchment. Slide back onto the baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Pour the filling into the crust. Gently slide the lattice off the parchment and onto the fruit, adjusting as needed; trim the excess dough if needed, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhanging dough under itself. Brush the lattice with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate the pie 30 minutes. Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a rack and let cool at least 2 hours.

 Ingredients: 
 1 can coconut milk (coco lopez) 
 1 can sweetened condensed milk 
 1 cup milk or heavy cream (your preference) 
 6 eggs, beaten slightly* 
 1 cup white rum 
 Instructions: 
 Mix all ingredients and adjust taste with more of whichever liquid you want. The cream and eggs will add richness and of course, more alcohol means a heavier punch. Store liquid in a large glass soda bottle with a pop off cap, one in which you can re-cap and lock. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 12-ounce bottle beer 
 4 cardamom pods 
 Zest of 1/2 orange, in large strips 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Pinch of sea salt 
 Instructions: 
 Bring the beer, cardamom and orange zest to a gentle boil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring, until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Add the butter and brown sugar and cook, stirring only if the mixture looks like it might boil over, until thick and syrupy, 10 to 12 minutes. To test for doneness, drop a bit of caramel into a bowl of cold water. It should form a soft ball; if it doesn't, keep cooking. Slowly stir in the cream and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and salt. Remove the cardamom and orange zest with a spoon. Let the caramel cool slightly, then transfer to a small jar. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Photograph by Lisa Shin <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil 
 2 large heads garlic 
 3 flour tortillas, recipe follows 
 1 cup carnitas, recipe follows, slightly warmed, or at room temperature 
 6 tablespoons grated Anejo cheese 
 Green Chile Paste, recipe follows 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over each head of garlic and then wrap in aluminum foil. Place on a cookie sheet and bake 1 hour 15 minutes, or until soft throughout. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, slice each head in half across the width and squeeze the roasted garlic paste into a bowl, discarding the skins. Lay the tortillas out on a counter and, with a spatula, spread a thin, even layer of garlic paste over the entire surface of each one. Divide the carnitas in thirds and spread over the bottom half of each tortilla. Sprinkle with the cheese. Fold over the top half to enclose the filling. Brush the top sides with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil. Heat a griddle or dry cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place a stuffed tortilla, oiled side down, in the pan and toast about a minute on each side, just to heat through. Keep warm on a tray in the oven while finishing the rest. Cut into wedges and serve immediately with the Green Chile Paste. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 teaspoon potato starch 
 1 tablespoon cocoa powder (extra brut preferred, 22 percent fat) 
 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 10 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 
 1/3 cup half-and-half 
 2 tablespoons brandy 
 1/2 cup sugar, plus 1/3 cup 
 1/4 cup water 
 7 egg whites 
 1 vanilla bean, split in 1/2 lengthwise 
 4 egg yolks 
 Caramel Crust, recipe follows 
 1 cup blanched sliced almonds, pulsed in a food processor to form large crumbles 
 3 tablespoons heavy cream 
 6 tablespoons sugar 
 Confectioners' sugar, for dusting 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 10-inch circular springform cake pan with parchment paper. Combine the potato starch, cocoa powder, and flour in a small bowl. Set aside. Melt the chocolate chips, half-and-half together in a double boiler. If you don't have a double boiler, then bring a pot of water to a simmer, turn the heat off, and melt the chocolate and half-and-half in a bowl set over the hot water, being careful not to get any water into the mixture. Add the brandy, stir to combine, and set aside. Make a meringue by combining 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then continue cooking until the syrup reaches 240 degrees F. With the wire whip attachment, whip the egg whites in an electric mixer until they form stiff peaks. Pour the hot syrup over the meringue with the mixer running. Continue whipping until cool, and then set aside. Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean into a large bowl. Alternatively, you may substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the vanilla bean, but the flavor will not be as spectacular. Add the egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar to the bowl and whisk until the ingredients have developed some body. Add the melted chocolate mixture and blend. Add the potato starch mixture, and stir until just combined. Fold in 1/3 of the meringue with a rubber spatula, and then fold in remaining meringue. Pour batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake has crusted, it does not jiggle, and the cake sticks to a toothpick when inserted in the center of the cake. Let cake cool completely on a wire rack. Pulse the almonds in a food processor until they form large crumbles. Leave the ground almonds in the food processor. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a double boiler or in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Melt the sugar in a copper pot, and then slowly drizzle in the cream, stirring with wooden spoon. Continue stirring, as the mixture will bubble rapidly. When the cream and sugar are combined, pour into the food processor through the feed tube while it is running. Stop processing when the mixture forms a ball. Using hands well dusted with confectioners' sugar, roll almond mixture into a ball, and place it between 2 sheets of dusted parchment paper. With a rolling pin, and using a very gentle motion, roll from the center in a direction away from you until you have a disk about 10 inches in diameter. Remove 1 layer of parchment paper, invert the cooled cake, remove the other layer of parchment paper, place it onto a cake board, flip over the cake, and remove the parchment from the top of the cake. Dust the sides of the cake with powdered sugar. <|endoftext|>

 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish 
 1 teaspoon lemon juice 
 Kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1 (15-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, drained 
 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, divided 
 Instructions: 
 In a serving bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mustard, parsley, bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Add the potato, shrimp, and celery. Toss everything together until it is all coated with the dressing and serve. Put the potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and add a generous pinch of salt. Cook for 8 minutes so they are tender but still slightly firm. Strain and let them cool. When they are cool, cut them in half and carefully scoop out the insides using a teaspoon or melon baller to form a cup. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the potato cups into a large bowl, add the oil, rosemary and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Carefully toss the potato cups to coat them with the oil. Arrange the potatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet and bake until the cups are browned and crisp, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the potatoes are baking, put the bacon into a cold skillet and cook over medium heat until crisp. Drain the bacon well on a baking sheet lined with a brown paper bag. (Reserve 2 pieces of bacon for Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing.) Chop the remaining 6 pieces. In a bowl stir together the sour cream, mustard, 1 tablespoon chives, the chopped bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Arrange the potatoes onto a serving plate and fill each with a spoonful of the sour cream and bacon mixture. Garnish with the remaining chives and serve immediately. Peel the length of each cucumber to form alternating stripes of unpeeled and peeled. Cut the cucumbers into 12 (3/4-inch) pieces. Scoop out the center using a teaspoon or a melon baller, leaving the bottom and sides intact to form a cup. (Reserve the centers for the Round 2 Recipe Chicken Tacos with Cucumber Salsa.) Turn them upside down onto a towel and let them drain while you make the filling. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the shrimp and cook until bright pink, about 3 to 4 minutes. Strain and rinse in cold water. Remove the shells and discard. (Reserve 12 shrimp for the Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing.) Chop the shrimp into small pieces and put them into a bowl. Add the horseradish, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, half the can of tomatoes (reserve the remaining half for the Round 2 Recipe Chicken Tacos with Cucumber Salsa) and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Evenly divide the shrimp mixture between the cucumber cups. Arrange them on a serving platter and garnish with remaining parsley. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 medium banana, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch pieces to yield about 3/4 cup 
 1/4 packed cup light brown sugar 
 1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts 
 16 won ton wrappers 
 1 egg, beaten 
 1/3 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella) or creamy peanut butter 
 Vegetable oil, for frying 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a small bowl, combine the banana, sugar and walnuts. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the edges of each won ton wrapper. Put about a teaspoon of the chocolate-hazelnut spread in the center of each wrapper and top with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the banana mixture.

Cool for 2 minutes and serve warm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra if needed 
 2 tablespoons brown sugar or honey 
 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, diced, plus extra melted to brush biscuits 
 3/4 cup mashed sweet potato, cold 
 1/3 cup buttermilk 
 1/4 cup golden raisins 
 2 tablespoon sorghum or molasses 
 2 tablespoons salt 
 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 One 4-pound pork loin 
 1 pound peeled and cored apples, cut into 1/2-inch chunks, or 12 ounces unsweetened applesauce 
 4 ounces light brown sugar 
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon ground allspice 
 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard 
 2 bunches arugula 
 1 pint grape tomatoes or baby heirlooms 
 1/4 cup sunflower seeds 
 2 lemons, juiced 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 ounces shaved Parmesan 
 Instructions: 
 For the sweet potato biscuits: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda and cayenne. Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir together the sweet potato and buttermilk in a separate bowl until smooth. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the sweet potato mixture. Add the raisins and combine until it just comes together. Be very careful to not over mix. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until it comes together. If the dough is too sticky, work in up to 1/4 cup additional flour. Shape into a disk and pat to an even 1- to 1 1/2-inch thickness. With a floured 3-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather together scraps, and repeat to cut out more biscuits. Butter a baking sheet and place each biscuit 1/2 inch apart. Brush with melted butter and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. For the peppered pork loin: In a small bowl, stir together the sorghum, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper and oil. Trim the pork loin of any excess fat, and transfer to a shallow roasting pan (or my favorite, a cast-iron skillet). Rub the pork loin with sorghum and spice mixture, coating evenly. Roast until the internal temperature is 140 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. For the apple mustard butter: Place the apple chunks in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over low heat. Cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard. (Or if using applesauce, place in a heavy bottomed pot with the sugar and spices and cook until it is thick, 30 minutes or so.) For the salad: Toss the arugula, tomatoes and sunflowers seeds in a large bowl. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Top with the shaved cheese. To serve: Split the sweet potato biscuits and spread the apple mustard butter on both sides. Thinly slice the pork loin and place on each of the bottom biscuits. Top with the other biscuit halves and serve with salad on the side. Recipe courtesy of Damaris Phillips <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 One 5-pound chuck blade roast, silver skin removed 
 Salt 
 1 pound slab pancetta, large dice 
 10 shallots, peeled and left whole 
 8 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 
 5 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 
 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 
 10 sprigs fresh thyme 
 2 fresh bay leaves (dry are o.k. too) 
 2 cups apple cider 
 48 ounces beer (preferably porter or IPA) 
 1 cup fresh mint leaves, torn 
 2 lemons, zest only 
 Instructions: 
 Sprinkle the roast liberally with salt (about 3 tablespoons), and refrigerate at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Pull the meat out an hour before cooking to take the chill off of it. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, render the pancetta until slightly crispy. Remove and reserve. Dry off the meat with a paper towel and begin to brown it in the same pan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes per side; remove and reserve. Reduce the heat to medium, add the shallots, carrots, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and sweat until slightly caramelized and the vegetables start to release their aromas, about 4 minutes. Add the coriander, thyme and bay leaves, and continue to sweat for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the cider, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to get all of the caramelized bits into the sauce. Add the beer and bring to a simmer. Add the beef back in along with the pancetta. The liquid should be about three-quarters of the way up the meat. Baste the meat with the liquid, top with a lid and place in the oven until tender, basting every hour, for 3 to 4 hours. Skim off any excess fat and gently remove the meat to a platter. Spoon the vegetables on top and garnish with the torn mint and lemon zest. <|endoftext|>

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the paneer and vegetables to marinate for 30 to 40 minutes, or longer in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and oil a baking sheet. Thread the vegetables and paneer alternately onto the skewers and place on the baking sheet. Bake the skewers in the oven for 7 minutes, drizzle over the melted butter, turn and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, or until charred at the edges. Sprinkle the skewers with chaat masala, and serve. The paneer skewers are also great served with green chutney. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 large onion, chopped 
 2 large green bell peppers, chopped 
 1 3 1/2-pound chicken 
 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1 1/4 pounds fresh chicken sausage 
 1 pound andouille sausage, thinly sliced 
 3/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into pieces 
 1 1/4 pounds smoked turkey thigh, skin and bones removed, cut into pieces 
 1 bunch scallions, chopped 
 1/4 cup Cajun seasoning 
 Cooked white rice, for serving (optional)

 Ingredients: 
 1 small fennel bulb, stalks discarded 
 3 medium carrots (1/2 pound) 
 1/2 pound small red potatoes 
 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, slivered 
 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh lemon zest 
 4 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves 
 2 large garlic cloves, minced 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 (1 1/2-pound) piece center-cut salmon fillet, skinned and fish cut into 4 square pieces 
 4 ounces (1 stick) butter, quartered evenly 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a mandoline or other manual slicer, 4 pieces parchment paper, kitchen string Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Halve fennel bulb lengthwise. Remove most of core, leaving enough intact to keep layers together when sliced. Using manual slicer, cut fennel bulb (lengthwise), carrots (diagonally), and potatoes into 1/8-inch-thick slices, keeping vegetables separate. Blanch vegetables, separately, in salted boiling water: fennel 2 minutes, carrots 1 minute, potatoes 2 minutes. Transfer fennel and carrots with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water then drain well. Drain potatoes. Toss fennel and carrots with olives, zest, thyme, half of garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Toss potatoes with remaining oil and garlic and salt and pepper, to taste. Fold the parchment paper in half along the longest side. Divide potato mixture among centers of parchment squares. Season salmon with salt and pepper and place on top of potatoes, then top salmon the fennel mixture. Add a pat of butter to the package and a squeeze of lemon juice. Fold the parchment paper up over fennel mixture and crimp the edges. Place packages directly on hot baking sheet in oven and cook 20 minutes. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 to 3 pounds lamb chops, not less than 1-inch thick 
 5 medium or 12 baby carrots 
 5 medium or 12 baby onions 
 8 potatoes 
 3 to 3 3/4 cups stock (lamb stock if possible) or water 
 1 sprig fresh thyme 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon roux, optional, recipe follows 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon freshly chopped parsley 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon freshly chopped chives 
 1 stick butter 
 Scant 1 cup flour 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the chops in 1/2 and trim off some of the excess fat. Set aside. Render down the fat on a gentle heat in a heavy pan (discard the rendered-down pieces). Peel the onions and scrape or thinly peel the carrots (if they are young you could leave some of the green stalk on the onion and carrot). Cut the carrots into large chunks, or if they are young leave them whole. If the onions are large, cut them small, if they are small they are best left whole. Toss the meat in the hot fat in a saucepan until it is slightly brown. Transfer the meat into a casserole, then quickly toss the onions and carrots in the fat. Build the meat, carrots and onions up in layers in the casserole, carefully season each layer with freshly ground pepper and salt. Deglaze the pan with lamb stock and pour it into the casserole. Peel the potatoes and lay them on top of the casserole, so they will steam while the stew cooks. Season the potatoes. Add a sprig of thyme, bring to a boil on top of the stove, cover and transfer to a moderate oven or allow to simmer on top of the stove until the stew is cooked, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When the stew is cooked, pour off the cooking liquid, degrease and reheat in another saucepan. Slightly thicken it with a little roux if you like. Check seasoning, then add chopped parsley and chives and pour it back over the stew. Bring it back up to boiling point and serve from the pot or in a large pottery dish. Melt the butter and cook the flour in it for 2 minutes on a low heat, stirring occasionally. Use as required. Roux can be stored in a cool place and used as required or it can be made up on the spot if preferred. It will keep 2 weeks in the refrigerator. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons vinegar 
 1 egg, beaten 
 1 pound lard 
 6 cups sifted flour 
 2 to 3 pounds round steak 
 4 medium potatoes 
 1 rutabaga 
 2 carrots 
 1 1/2 onions, diced 
 Salt 
 Pepper 
 Butter 
 1 egg 
 Water 
 Instructions: 
 Put the vinegar in a 1-cup measuring cup and fill the remainder with water. Add the beaten egg to a small bowl and add the vinegar and water and mix together. In a large mixing bowl cut the lard into the flour. Add the liquid and mix together. The less you handle the dough the better the crust will be. When the mixture is totally combined into the dough cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place into the refrigerator until you will be putting the pasties together. Trim all of the fat from the steak and dice into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel and dice potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel and dice rutabaga into pieces smaller than the potatoes. Peel and dice carrots into pieces smaller than the potatoes. Place all ingredients into a very large mixing bowl and combine thoroughly with your hands. Be sure to start with clean hands and nails. Add the salt and pepper and mix the ingredients to combine. My mother used enough pepper to turn the entire bowl black before mixing the ingredients. Roll out the pie crust and place bottom crusts into 2 (9-inch) pie tins. Do not grease the pie tins before adding the crust. Next, fill the pie tin with the meat and vegetable mixture. It should be heaping since the mixture will cook down. Before placing the top crust in place, add a large pat of butter to the top of the pie filling. Remember we cut off all the fat on the meat earlier. Place top pie crust and trim to finish. You can use the finger-and-thumb method to finish the crust, like Grandma did, or you can use a fork to finish the crust. Before placing into the oven, cut 2 slits in the crust for steam to leave the pastie while cooking. Also using the egg and a little water, make an egg wash to brush on the crust. This will give the crust a golden, shiny finish. Bake the Pasties in a preheated 350 to 375 degree oven, middle rack for 90 minutes. Watch the crust so that it doesn't get too brown in the cooking process. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 racks baby back ribs (about 2 1/2 pounds) 
 1 recipe Bourbon Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows 
 1/2 cup steak sauce 
 1/2 cup bourbon or good dark beer 
 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon regular or grainy Dijon mustard 
 2 pinches red pepper flakes 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the racks of ribs in half crosswise. Rub the ribs, paying special attention to the meaty side, with 1/2 cup of the sauce. Lay the rib pieces meat side down in an 11 by 13-inch baking dish. The pieces will overlap slightly. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the meat begins to pull away from the ends of the bones and the ribs are just tender, about 1 hour. You can bake the ribs up to a day before and keep them refrigerated. Bring refrigerated ribs to room temperature about 1 hour before you grill them. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Grill the ribs, brushing them with about half the remaining sauce, until they're crispy and heated through, about 10 minutes. Move the ribs around as they grill, the sugar in barbecue sauce makes it easy for them to burn. Let the ribs rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting them into 1 or 2-bone pieces. Put out the rest of the sauce for dipping or brush it over the ribs. Stir all ingredients together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds in-shell raw Virginia or Valencia peanuts 
 3 ounces kosher salt 
 3 gallons water 
 Instructions: 
 Wash the peanuts in cool water until the water runs clear. Soak in cool water for 30 minutes to loosen any remaining dirt. Drain and rinse the peanuts. Add the peanuts to a 12-quart pot along with the salt and 3 gallons of water. Stir well. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours. Check the texture of the peanut at this point for doneness. When done, boiled peanuts should have a similar texture to a cooked dry bean. It should hold its shape, but not crunch when bitten. Add more water throughout the cooking process, if needed. If necessary, continue cooking for 3 to 4 hours longer. Drain the peanuts and store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. *Cook's note: The cooking time can vary greatly depending on how fresh the peanuts are. The fresher the peanut, the less time it will take to cook. <|endoftext|>

Serve the remaining sauce on the side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 
 1/2 cup lukewarm water (approximately 80 degrees F) 
 4 cups bread flour 
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 
 All-purpose flour, for dusting 
 1 cup canned whole peeled tomatoes (pelati) 
 Kosher salt 
 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
 1/4 pound pancetta, diced medium 
 1/2 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded 
 4 large eggs 
 1 handful fresh basil leaves 
 Instructions: 
 For the pizza dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast, lukewarm water, and 1/2 cup of the bread flour. Mix well and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until bubbly, like foamy beer. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt until evenly combined. Add 3/4 cup cold water and the olive oil to the yeast mixture. Turn on the mixer and begin adding the flour mixture in increments, then mix for 5 minutes, until the dough starts creeping up the dough hook and detaching from the sides of the bowl. Grease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Turn the dough to coat its surface with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a tea towel. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down, then let rise another 1 hour. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and form into discs. On a work surface lightly dusted with flour, use your fingers or the heel of your hand (and a rolling pin, if you prefer) to stretch the discs until they're 13 inches in diameter. The disc should be very thin, less than 1/8 inch. For the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F for 1 hour before baking. (Or preheat a wood-fired pizza oven to very hot, 4 hours before baking.) In a food processor, puree the tomatoes until smooth. Season with salt to taste. In a skillet, heat the olive oil and pancetta over medium heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until crisp. Using a spoon, spread one-fourth of the pureed tomatoes on 1 disc of dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Sprinkle one-fourth of the mozzarella on top. Gently place the pizza on the pizza stone and bake for about 5 minutes, until golden with slight signs of charring. (If using a wood-fired oven, gently place the pizza on the oven floor, and bake for 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp.) Remove the pizza from the oven and break an egg over the center of the pizza. Top with one-fourth of the cooked pancetta, return the pizza to the oven, and bake another 3 to 4 minutes (1 to 2 minutes if using a wood-fired oven), until the egg is cooked. Remove the pizza from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and top with one-fourth of the basil. Serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining 3 pizza discs. IMPORTANTE! If you're making pizza within the hour after forming the pizza dough discs, they can be kept at room temperature. Otherwise, place them on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 12 hours before baking, as long as the dough doesn't rise too much, because acidity will creep in and the flavor will sour. Ideally, though, you should make the pizzas the same day you make the dough. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 grapefruits 
 7 1/2-pounds (about 17 cups) sugar 
 1/2 cup light corn syrup 
 3 3/4 cups water 
 Instructions: 
 Cut tops off grapefruits, a third of the way down from stem end. Place trimmed bottoms in 8-quart stockpot; cover with 3 quarts water. Cover surface of water directly with a piece of parchment paper cut to same size diameter as the stockpot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours. Remove grapefruits; place upside down on a wire rack to drain. Reserve parchment round. When cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh with a spoon (do not puncture grapefruit skin). Discard flesh. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and 3 3/4 cups water in the stockpot; bring to boil over medium-high heat, using a wet pastry brush to brush down sugar crystals that form on side of pot. Clip candy thermometer to pot; cook until syrup reaches thread stage (230 degrees). Add grapefruit bowls; reduce heat. Cover with reserved parchment round and simmer at least 1 hour, occasionally turning gently. Grapefruits should be unevenly translucent. Turn off heat; let cool in syrup until completely translucent, about 2 hours. Using whisk small enough to fit in bowls, gently lift them from syrup. Place upside down on rack over baking sheet. Let dry overnight. Store in airtight container lined with parchment paper. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 
 3 1/2 sticks (14 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 Decorating sugar and Royal Icing, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Sift together the flour and salt into a large bowl. Put the butter into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on medium speed until fluffy and light, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla, and mix until combined. Reduce the speed to low, and slowly add the flour and salt mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing on low speed until the dough comes together and is smooth. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Cut the dough into quarters, wrap each piece in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. When you're ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 9 by 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it soften slightly. Using a rolling pin dusted with flour, roll out one of the dough quarters, (keeping the others refrigerated until you need them), on a lightly floured work surface to 1/4- to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the cookies into the desired shapes, and then use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to one of the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 1 1/2 inches apart. Sprinkle the cookies with decorating sugar, if desired. Repeat with the remaining dough. Bake the cookies until they are light brown around the edges and on the bottom, 8 to 12 minutes. Cool briefly on the sheets, and use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. <|endoftext|>

Spread the pecans out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool and then pulse in a food processor until very finely chopped but not ground. Combine the chopped pecans, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the brown sugar, yogurt, oil, vanilla extract, lemon zest and eggs in another bowl. Stir the carrots into the egg mixture. Fold the carrot-egg mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. Divide evenly among the prepared pans. (Don't be alarmed if the batter seems skimpy; the cakes will rise once baked.) Bake until the center of the cakes bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for a few minutes, and then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the glaze: Mix together the confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract and salt in a medium bowl. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the glaze onto each cake and use the back of the spoon to spread. Garnish as desired. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 
 8 cloves garlic, peeled 
 8 Roma tomatoes, halved and seeded 
 2 red peppers, quartered and seeded 
 1 medium onion, quartered 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 One 6-ounce can tomato paste 
 6 cups vegetable stock 
 1/4 cup loosely packed chiffonade fresh basil, for serving 
 Herbed Flatbread, for serving, recipe follows 
 One 16-ounce ball pizza dough (purchased from local pizza parlor or supermarket) 
 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh lemon thyme 
 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh rosemary 
 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for coating bowl 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 cloves garlic, smashed 
 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Blender or immersion blender Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Gently toss together 2 tablespoons of the oil, the vinegar, thyme, garlic, tomatoes, red peppers and onions on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange the tomatoes and red peppers skin-side up and bake until lightly charred, 45 to 50 minutes. Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the tomato paste and mix well. Add the tomato and pepper mixture, including the juices, and combine. Stir in the stock; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, about 20 minutes. Transfer the soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and pulse in small batches that reach only about one-third to halfway up the side of the jar. Be careful to start slow and then increase the speed to blitz the ingredients until smooth. Use a separate bowl to hold the blended soup, and then return it all to the pot. Heat the soup to warm through, and then ladle into serving bowls. Garnish with the basil and serve with the Herbed Flatbread. Roll the pizza dough out to about 1-inch thick. Sprinkle evenly with the herbs and roll into a log. Then knead 3 to 4 minutes to evenly incorporate the herbs. Reform the dough into a ball and place in a small bowl lightly coated with olive oil. Set aside to rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with the garlic and red onions. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Brush a baking sheet with oil. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush about half the garlic butter on top. Remove the garlic and onions with a slotted spoon and scatter over the top. Bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, brush with the remaining garlic butter and sprinkle with salt. Cut into 2 inch strips and serve. From Food Network Kitchens; after further testing and to ensure the best results this recipe has been altered from what was in the actual episode. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Flour, for dusting 
 2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed 
 6 tablespoons tomato paste 
 6 tablespoons prepared olive tapenade 
 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella 
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 
 1 egg 
 2 tablespoons water 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out puff pastry to a 10 by 10-inch square. Spread 3 tablespoons of tomato paste evenly on top, followed by 3 tablespoons of olive tapenade. Sprinkle half of mozzarella and Parmesan over top. Roll up the puff pastry like a jelly roll, just to the middle of the dough. Repeat with the other side in the same fashion, making 2 rolls that meet in the center. Duplicate the process with the second puff pastry sheet. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Slice the rolls into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange on cookie sheet and refrigerate for 20 minutes. (Because they will puff up to twice their size after baking, place them far enough apart.) Just before baking, beat the egg with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl, and brush onto the olive crisp slices. Bake for 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Serve warm or room temperature. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 pounds crookneck yellow squash or other yellow summer squash 
 1/4 pound zucchini or additional yellow summer squash 
 1/2 cup coarse-chopped carrots 
 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 
 1 large onion, preferably yellow, chopped 
 1 plump garlic clove, minced 
 1 1/4 cups saltine or Ritz cracker crumbs 
 1/2 cup grated mild to medium Cheddar cheese 
 Hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco 
 Salt and freshly milled black pepper 
 2 eggs, lightly beaten 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a medium baking dish. Slice the yellow squash and zucchini lengthwise into quarters, then cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Place the yellow squash, zucchini and carrots in a saucepan, barely cover with water and salt well. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium and cover. Cook about 20 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Meanwhile, warm 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion and cook slowly until very soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional minute. Scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl. Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium-low heat, and add to it the remaining tablespoon of butter. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cracker crumbs and cook briefly until the crumbs are golden. Scrape them onto a small plate and reserve them. Drain the squash mixture, mashing the vegetables just a bit. Spoon it into the mixing bowl. Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup of cracker crumbs, cheese and a good splash or two of the pepper sauce. Salt and pepper generously to taste. Stir in the eggs and spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Scatter the toasted cracker crumbs over the top.

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons sugar 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 to 2/3 cup salad oil 
 3 to 4 tablespoons milk 
 1 quart fresh blueberries, washed 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 Dash ground cinnamon 
 Dash freshly grated nutmeg 
 1 teaspoon lemon juice 
 4 teaspoons butter 
 Instructions: 
 Crust: Into a 9-inch pie plate, sift together the flour, sugar, and the salt. In a glass measuring cup, whisk together 1/2 cup salad oil and 3 tablespoons milk with a fork. Pour that over the flour mixture in pie plate and mix with a fork until all flour is evenly dampened. If it is still too dry to work with your hands, mix a little more oil with a little milk and add to flour mixture. With your hands press the dough evenly against the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, allowing the excess to fall on the counter. (This will be the top crumble crust and is about 1/3 of the total crust mixture.) Sweep it into your hand and reserve in a small bowl. Crimp the edges of the bottom crust or use a fork dipped in milk to flatten the crust along the rim. Berry pie filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To the washed berries add cornstarch, sugar, cinnamon, and freshly grated nutmeg. Stir gently. Place the berry mixture in the bottom crust and sprinkle lemon juice over it. Then with an ordinary teaspoon, place little 1/2 teaspoons soft butter evenly over the top of the berry filling. Crumble the reserved crust on top of the pie. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes. Check it after 30 minutes. If crust is getting golden but pie filling is not quite congealed, tent the pie with aluminum foil to keep crust from getting too brown. Serve with vanilla ice cream. <|endoftext|>

 4 cups chopped yellow onions (2 large) 
 1/4 cup flour 
 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 2 cups milk

 Ingredients: 
 1 black raspberry candy 
 1 frosted cupcake (about 2 tablespoons frosting works best) 
 21 chewy fish-shaped candies, 8 of 1 color, 13 of another 
 Instructions: 
 Put the raspberry candy in the center of the cupcake. Put 8 fish, heads up, in a petal pattern around the raspberry. Put the remaining 13 fish in a petal pattern around the first set. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (6 to 7 pound) whole salmon, gutted and scaled 
 Sea salt 
 1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced 
 1 lemon, thinly sliced 
 1 small bunch copper fennel fronds or substitute regular fennel fronds 
 10 sprigs fresh thyme 
 Olive oil, as needed 
 All-purpose flour, as needed 
 Instructions: 
 Fire up the grill, with the coals lined up under the fish for direct grilling. Sprinkle sea salt generously in the cavity of the fish and over the skin, then stuff it with the onions, lemons, fronds, and herb sprigs. Tie butcher string around the fish in three or four places to hold the stuffing in. In between the string, make deep incisions with your knife through the thickest part of the fish on both sides, all the way down to the spine. (The fish will cook more quickly, and the smoke flavor will get inside the fish better.) Brush both the fish and the grill lightly with oil, dust the salmon skin on both sides lightly with flour, and place the salmon on the grill. Grill over medium-hot direct heat, with the cover on and the vents open. When the skin is browned on 1 side, use 2 large metal spatulas to loosen the salmon from the grate and carefully turn over. Continue cooking until just cooked through and an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the fish registers 135 degrees F to 140 degrees F, about 35 to 40 minutes total cooking time. Remove the fish from the grill and place it on a large platter. Allow the fish to cool for 5 minutes, then remove the butcher string and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 1 cup sugar, plus more for dusting pan 
 6 1/2 ounces best-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped 
 3 egg yolks 
 1 egg 
 6 egg whites 
 Cocoa powder or confectioners' sugar, for dusting 
 Instructions: 
 Heat oven to 300 degrees F. Grease a 10-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon butter, and dust generously with granulated sugar. Melt chocolate and butter over simmering water in a double boiler, until melted about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. In an electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip the yolks and whole egg with 2/3 cup sugar on a high speed, until it is pale yellow and falls in a thick ribbon when the beater is raised, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice during mixing. Set aside. In an electric mixer, using a second whisk attachment and bowl, (both should be clean and free of grease) whip the egg whites with remaining 1/3 cup sugar on high speed until thick and foamy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside. While the whites are beating, add the cooled melted chocolate slowly to the yolk mixture. Temper the whipped egg whites by mixing in about 1/4 cup of the chocolate mixture. Then gently fold the whites into the chocolate yolk mixture, working quickly to maintain the volume of the whites; the mixture will have a slightly marbleized appearance. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place in heated oven, and bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool in the pan on a cooling rack. When completely cool, gently run a knife around the edges of the pan and release spring. Dust with cocoa powder or confectioners' sugar before serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 24 dried corn husks 
 Boiling water 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 pounds chicken thighs, with skin and bone 
 1 medium onion, chopped 
 4 garlic cloves, chopped 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 
 1 tablespoon chili powder 
 2 teaspoons ground cumin 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 
 1 cup (4-ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese 
 Salsa Roja, recipe follows 
 Classic Southern Cornbread, recipe follows 
 1 pound tomatillos, husks removed 
 10 dried chiles de arbol 
 1(8-ounce) can tomato sauce 
 1/2 medium white onion, coarsely chopped 
 1 garlic clove, crushed 
 2 cups yellow or white cornmeal, preferably stoneground 
 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 2 cups buttermilk 
 2 large eggs, beaten 
 1/4 cup vegetable oil, preferably sunflower, plus additional for the pan 
 Instructions: 
 To make the tamales: Place the corn husks in a large bowl and add enough boiling water to cover. Submerge in the water by weighting down with another bowl. Let stand until the husks soften, about 1 hour. Drain well and pat dry. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion to the fat in the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the cilantro, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne. Return the chicken to the skillet and add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Cool until easy to handle. Discard the skin and bones and coarsely chop the meat. Transfer to a medium bowl. Meanwhile, let the cooking liquid stand off the heat for 5 minutes. Skim off and discard the fat on the surface. Return the skillet to the stove and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze, about 20 minutes. Scrape the glaze onto the chicken, then add the cheese. To make the tamales, place a corn husk on the work surface. Spread about 3 tablespoons of the Classic Cornbread batter in a 2 to 3-inch square area in the center of the husk. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken in the center of the batter and top with about 1 tablespoon of the batter. Fold the sides of the husk to enclose the batter (the tamale is now about 2 1/2 inches wide). Fold over the ends of the husk so the tamale is about 3 inches long. Place the tamale, smooth side up, on the work surface. Using kitchen twine, tie up the tamale with kitchen string, gift-box fashion. Repeat with the remaining husks, batter and chicken. (You may have some husks left over since you soaked more than you needed, in case some got torn.) Stand the tamales up, side by side, in a steamer inserted in a large pot. Add enough water to the pot to barely reach the bottom of the steamer. Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Steam the tamales until the batter is firm (open a tamale to check), about 1 hour. (The tamales can be made up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, and refrigerated. Steam over boiling water for 15 minutes to reheat.) Serve hot, with the Salsa Roja passed on the side. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the tomatillos and cook just until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat until very hot. Cook the chiles, turning frequently, until they turn a darker shade, about 3 minutes. Do not burn them. Transfer to a plate and cool. Cut open and discard the seeds and stems. (Wear plastic gloves if your hands are sensitive, and do not touch your eyes or other delicate parts of your body until you wash your hands well.) Puree the tomatillos, chiles, tomato sauce, onion, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Season, to taste, with salt. Cool completely. (The salsa can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated.) Yield: 6 to 8 servings Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl to combine. Make a well in the center. Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until the eggs are well combined. Pour into the well and stir just until the batter is moistened ? do not overbeat. Yield: 6 to 8 servings <|endoftext|>

 1 pound russet baking potatoes (about 2 medium) 
 3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 Freshly grated nutmeg 
 5 ounces (about 1/2 cup) fresh robiola or mascarpone 
 Instructions: 
 Keeping cabbage whole, cut out and discard core and any discolored outer leaves. Beginning at top of head and working with 1 leaf at a time, remove 6 outer leaves, rolling each one back on itself until it can be loosened intact from head and reserve. Cut remaining cabbage head into 8 wedges and cut each wedge crosswise into 3 pieces. Separate layers of cabbage pieces. Peel parsnips and diagonally cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Bring a large kettle of salted water to boil and cook reserved cabbage leaves until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer cabbage leaves to a kitchen towel to drain. Add cabbage pieces to boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer pieces to colander to drain and transfer to a bowl. Add potatoes to boiling water and cook just tender, about 4 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer potatoes to colander to drain and transfer to another bowl. Add parsnips to boiling water and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain parsnips in colander. In a 12-inch heavy skillet cook onion in 3 tablespoons butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add cabbage pieces, salt, nutmeg, and pepper to taste and cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes. If any liquid remains in skillet, cook mixture over high heat until liquid is evaporated, about 1 minute. If using robiola, cut into pieces. Stir robiola or mascarpone into cabbage mixture and cook over moderate heat, stirring until cheese is melted. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart ovenproof round serving dish (about 8 1/2 to 9 inches across and 2 1/2 inches deep) and line with cabbage leaves, letting leaves overhang 1 to 2 inches. Arrange half of potatoes in serving dish and season with salt and pepper. Top potatoes in dish with half of cabbage mixture and arrange half of parsnips over cabbage. Repeat layering with remaining potatoes, cabbage mixture, and parsnips, arranging last layer of parsnips decoratively around edge of casserole and leaving cabbage exposed in center. Dot parsnips with remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter. Fold cabbage leaves over parsnips and cover tightly with a double layer of foil. Casserole may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled. Bring casserole to room temperature before proceeding. Bake casserole until heated through and bubbling, about 1 hour. Let casserole stand 10 minutes before serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 medium tomato, diced 
 1-ounce feta cheese, crumbled (approximately 2 tablespoons) 
 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves, chopped 
 1/4 cup hearts of palm, packed in water, drained and diced (about 1/4 of a 14-ounce can) 
 1 large portobello mushroom, diced 
 8 sheets phyllo dough 
 2 tablespoons tomato paste 
 1 spray canola oil cooking spray 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss tomato, feta, oregano, hearts of palm, and portobello until well combined. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough on a clean work surface and brush lightly with tomato paste. Top with another sheet of the phyllo dough. Take 1/4 of the mushroom mixture and place it on the phyllo dough, about 1-inch from 1 end, leaving a border at the bottom and top. Fold the bottom of the sheet to cover the filling, then fold the top of the sheet so that it covers the filling. Now roll the unfolded end over the filling so that a packet is formed around the filling and there are not open sides. Set on a wire rack placed on top of a cookie sheet. Repeat process 3 more times. After you have finished the 4 packets, lightly spray once with the canola oil cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 
 1 2/3 cups sugar 
 2 large eggs, at room temperature 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 Royal Icing Cookie Paint, recipe follows 
 3 large egg whites, at room temperature* 
 1 pound (1 box) confectioners' sugar 
 Instructions: 
 In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to evenly combine. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, stopping the mixer once or twice to scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each until thoroughly incorporated. Add the vanilla. Scrape the bowl again and mix for a few more seconds. On low speed, add 1/2 the dry ingredients. Beat until combined. Add the remaining dry ingredients and beat just until the flour is completely absorbed into the dough. Turn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass. Form it into a log and divide into 3 even parts. Flatten each section into a patty about 1/2-inch thick and cover each with plastic wrap. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. The dough may also be frozen for up to 1 month. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Let the dough sit at room temperature, still covered, for about 20 minutes to soften slightly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to slightly more than 1/8-inch thick. Cut out shapes with cookie cutters, as close together as possible, and use a palate knife or metal spatula to transfer to ungreased baking sheets, placing them about 1-inch apart. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Press the scraps together, roll them out, and cut, always brushing off any excess flour, until all used up. Bake cookies for about 17 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden. Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a handheld mixer, begin to beat the egg whites and sugar on low speed. Be sure the bowl and beaters are free of any fat and that there is no egg yolk in the whites. After 30 seconds or so, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and gradually increase the speed of the mixer to medium. Beat until the mixer thickens and stiffens, about 3 minutes. STORING ICING: Keep Royal Icing in an airtight container. To prevent a crust from forming while using the icing, keep the container covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Royal Icing will keep refrigerated for up to 2 days. Before reusing, lightly beat with a whisk or fork. Yield: 2 1/2 cups icing to cover about 4 to 6 dozen 3-inch cookies *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 loaf day-old French bread, crusts cut off and cubed 
 1/2 cup raisins 
 1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped 
 1 banana, diced 
 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans, optional 
 3 eggs 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 tablespoon cinnamon 
 1 1/2 teaspoons nutmeg 
 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
 1 cup milk 
 1 cup coffee 
 Bourbon Sauce, recipe follows 
 16 tablespoons butter 
 2 cups sugar 
 2 eggs 
 2 cups bourbon 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, place the bread cubes, raisins, apple, banana, and nuts (if using) and toss to combine. In a medium bowl with a whisk, combine the eggs, sugar, spices, vanilla, milk, and coffee. Pour the egg mixture over the bread cube mixture and let sit 15 minutes. Pour into a 2-inch deep greased baking pan and bake for 45 minutes. To serve, pour the Bourbon Sauce over the bread pudding. For individual servings, place large spoonfuls of the bread pudding into ovenproof dessert dishes and ladle the sauce over liberally. Place bread pudding under the broiler and broil until bubbly and caramelized. In a mixer with a whip attachment, cream the butter and sugar together then mix in the eggs well. Transfer this to a double boiler and begin to heat it over very low heat. Stir with a wooden spoon until it is loose enough to fall from the spoon. Add the bourbon and stir in. Place the mixture in a heavy saucepan and cook it at a very, very, very low temperature for 2 hours. This maybe more sauce than you will need, but it tastes best cooked in this size. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 12 (10-inch) flour tortillas 
 2 pounds turkey sausage, recipe follows 
 1 1/2 pound mozzarella, shredded 
 3/4 cup roasted red bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch long strips 
 1 cup basil pesto, recipe follows 
 2/3 cup chicken broth 
 2 ounces chipotle chiles in adobo sauce 
 2 pounds ground turkey 
 1 tablespoon ground sage 
 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
 1 tablespoon ground cumin 
 3 tablespoons salt 
 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 
 1 cup fresh basil leaves, firmly packed 
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/2 cup pecans or pine nuts 
 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 Arrange flour tortillas on a table. Six of the tortillas will be sandwich tops and 6 will be bottoms. Sprinkle the turkey sausage evenly on 6 bottom tortillas. Next, sprinkle 4 to 5 ounces of mozzarella cheese over the turkey sausage. (As the quesadillas cook, the cheese will melt and act as glue to hold the quesadilla together.) Add 5 or 6 strips of red bell pepper over the mozzarella and turkey sausage. Finally, spread a thin layer of basil pesto on each of the remaining 6 flour tortilla tops and press it firmly on top of the bottom tortilla section. Preheat your grill to low heat. Place the quesadillas on the grill and cook until grill marks are present and the quesadilla turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. The inside should be warm and the cheese should be melted. Once finished cooking, remove the quesadilla from the grill, cut into 6 wedges, and serve with your favorite salsa. Place the chicken broth and chipotle chiles with adobo sauce in a blender, and puree until smooth, about 1 minute. In a large skillet over medium high heat, begin cooking the turkey sausage. Then add in the chipotle chile mixture and cook until the meat is crumbly and well done, about 10 to 15 minutes. Toward the end of the cooking, add in your sage, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cool the sausage mixture before spooning it onto the tortillas. Put the basil and olive oil into a food processor and blend until smooth. Next, add the pecans, Parmesan, and salt. Continue to blend until smooth, adding more olive oil, if necessary, to achieve a smooth consistency. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups/457 g flour, plus extra for dusting if needed 
 2 tablespoons/28 g cocoa powder 
 Pinch salt 
 2 tablespoons/28 g cold margarine 
 1/2 cup/118 ml white wine 
 1/4 cup/58 ml water 
 Extra-virgin olive oil, for deep-frying 
 1 1/2 pound/680 g fresh sheep's milk ricotta cheese 
 1 cup/228 g sugar 
 1 cup/228 g grated bittersweet chocolate 
 Candied fruit, finely sliced 
 Icing sugar (confectioners' sugar) 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Cannoli molds (tubes for shaping shells during frying) To make the cannoli shells: In large bowl, mix together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and cut in the margarine until evenly blended. Then gradually work in the wine and water to form a compact dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for an hour. On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out 5-inch-wide circles and cover. Re-roll the scrap dough to form more circles. In a deep-fat fryer or heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Wrap each circle onto a mold, sealing the two edges that overlap with a dab of water and by pressing together. Carefully immerse a few shells at a time, into the hot oil and fry until golden and crisp. Drain the shells on paper towels, let cool and remove the molds from the cannoli. To make the filling: In a bowl, whip up the ricotta and sugar until creamy. Add the grated chocolate. Mix thoroughly. Using a piping bag, pipe the filling into each shell, starting at the middle and working out towards each end. Garnish the ends of each cannoli with sliced candied fruit and then dust the cannoli with icing sugar. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 whole (8 pound) capon chicken 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
 1/4 pound unsalted butter, softened 
 2 lemons, cut in half, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
 1/4 cup fresh chopped herbs, such as tarragon, thyme or savory 
 1 onion, cut in half 
 4 garlic cloves, smashed 
 Fresh whole herbs, such as tarragon leaves, thyme and savory sprigs 
 2 cups water 
 1/4 cup sherry 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity and rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix together the butter, lemon juice and chopped herbs. Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken. Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic and whole herbs inside the bird. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape. Place the chicken, breast side down, on a V-rack in a roasting pan. Cooking the chicken on a rack helps make its skin crisp and keeps it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Pour water in the roasting pan to prevent the fat drippings from burning and smoking. Roast the chicken for about 20 minutes, then carefully turn the bird over breast side up. It is best to take the pan out of the oven, close the oven door to maintain the temperature, and rotate the chicken on the counter. Baste the chicken all over with the pan drippings. Turn the heat down to 375 degrees F and return the pan to the oven. Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees to 170 degrees F, count on this taking about 2 hours. Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes so the juices settle back into the meat before carving. Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator or measuring cup to let the fat rise to the top. Skim and discard the fat then return the pan juices back in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat. Add the sherry and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with chicken. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 large onions, quartered 
 2 medium carrots, quartered 
 2 stalks celery with leaves, quartered 
 10 sprigs parsley 
 4 sprigs fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried 
 1 bay leaf 
 5 pounds chicken bones, wings, backs, legs, wings, or a mixture, trimmed of excess fat 
 Instructions: 
 In a large stockpot, combine the onions, carrots and celery. Toss in the parsley, thyme and bay leaf and add the chicken parts or bones. Add enough cold water to cover the chicken by 3 inches. Bring to a boil over medium heat, lower the heat immediately so the stock simmers very gently. Skim the surface of any foam, scum, or fat, with a ladle, as often as necessary. Simmer, uncovered for 4 hours. Strain into a large bowl or storage containers. Cool the liquid to room temperature before refrigerating. (The fastest way to cool containers of stock is in an ice water bath in the sink.) Refrigerate for 2 or 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Remove any solidified fat that rises to the surface before using. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 Italian panettone, about 1.2 pounds 
 Unsalted butter, for greasing the dish 
 3 extra-large whole eggs 
 8 extra-large egg yolks 
 5 cups half-and-half 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/3 cup sliced almonds 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Trim the dark brown outer crust from the panettone (optional). Cut the rest of the loaf in 1-inch cubes and place on a sheet pan in a single layer. Toast the panettone for 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Grease a 9 by 12 by 2-inch baking dish with the butter. Place the panettone cubes in the baking dish. In a large bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, half-and-half, vanilla and almond extracts and sugar. Pour this custard mixture over the panettone. Set aside for 10 minutes so the bread soaks up the custard. Scatter the sliced almonds over the top of the pudding. Place the baking dish into a larger pan and add very hot tap water to the larger pan until it's halfway up the side of the baking dish. Cover the larger pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil so it doesn't touch the pudding. Cut a few holes in the foil to allow steam to escape. Bake the pudding for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 40 to 45 more minutes, until the custard is set and the top of the pudding is light golden brown. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 ( 9-ounce) box pie crust mix 
 1/3 cup apple cider 
 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, for rolling 
 4 pears, such as Red Bartlett 
 splash of lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1/4 cup brown sugar 
 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, divided 
 1 large egg 
 2 tablespoon sugar 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the pie crust mix and 1/3 cup cold apple cider until it forms a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill one hour in the refrigerator. Peel and core the pear and chop into approximately 1/2 inch pieces, (reserve 1 cup for Round 2 Recipe Cabbage and Pear Slaw, toss with a splash of lemon juice to prevent browning) In a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. When it is melted, add the pears. Cook until the pears are slightly softened and the liquid thickens, about 5 to 6 minutes. Let cool. On a floured surface or on parchment paper, roll out the chilled dough into a 12-inch-by-10-inch rectangle. Spread the cooled pear mixture in the middle of the rectangle, fold in the short ends, and roll the crust over enclosing the pear mixture. Place the strudel, seam side down, onto a baking sheet. In a small bowl beat the egg with a tablespoon of water. In another small bowl mix together the remaining 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and sugar. Brush the strudel with the egg wash and sprinkle with half the spiced sugar. Make five small slits on top to let the steam escape. Bake until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes. When you are ready to serve, whip the cream with the remaining pumpkin pie spice and sugar mixture. Serve the strudel topped with whipped cream. <|endoftext|>

 1 tablespoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 
 1/4 teaspoon allspice 
 3 pounds flank steak 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat a grill pan over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes Combine the mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, cayenne and allspice in a small bowl. Rub the flank steak all over with the mix and let sit for 10 minutes. Put the steak on the hot grill and cook 5 minutes per side. Remove and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 One 2 1/4-inch-thick porterhouse steak 
 Sea salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Let the steak come to room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the grill to high heat. Sprinkle the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides and grill over high heat, about 6 minutes per side. You're looking for a nice crust on each side, but to be true to the Fiorentina method, it should be rare on the inside. If you prefer not to eat your meat rare, cook it a little longer on each side, about 8 minutes per side for medium and longer for well done. Then let it rest for about 10 minutes before you carve into it. Cut the steak off of the bone, carving the strip off on one side and the filet off on the other. Then slice the meat against the grain and serve it on a cutting board or platter with the bone (true Fiorentina style). <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups heavy cream, plus 3/4 cup heavy cream, whipped to very soft peaks 
 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 
 2 oranges, zested (about 1/4 cup) 
 3 sheets gelatin 
 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar 
 1/4 cup milk 
 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 
 Sugared Champagne Grapes, recipe follows 
 1 tablespoon powdered egg white* 
 2 tablespoons lukewarm water 
 1 bunch fresh Champagne grapes 
 1 cup superfine or caster sugar 
 *available at fine food and bake shops 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: 8 (4-ounce) molds In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the heavy cream, vanilla bean, seeds and orange zest. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until it's reduced to 1 1/2 cups. In the meantime place the gelatin sheets in a bowl and cover with cold water, about 5 minutes. Pour off water and squeeze any excess water from the softened gelatin sheets. Remove the cream mixture from heat. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar until fully incorporated. Whisk in the softened gelatin sheets, milk, and orange juice and let stand for 3 minutes. Stir to ensure that the gelatin sheets are well dissolved. Strain through a very fine sieve into a medium mixing bowl. Place mixture in an ice bath, stirring continually for about 3 minutes to allow it to thicken slightly. Gently stir in half of the whipped heavy cream and then gently fold in the remaining cream. Divide the mixture into the individual molds, filling the molds 1/4-inch from the top. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until the panna cottas have cooled completely and the gelatin has set. To unmold the panna cotta, take the molds directly from the refrigerator and carefully dip them in hot water for 15 seconds. Run a sharp knife around the sides of the mold. Invert the molds over a plate and serve immediately with Sugared Champagne Grapes. Sugared Champagne Grapes: Whisk together the powdered egg white and water until frothy and light. Brush the champagne grapes lightly with the egg white mixture and roll in 1/2 cup of the sugar. Place the sugared grapes on a bed of the remaining sugar and dry at room temperature for several hours. <|endoftext|>

Reserve 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, and the stalk of fennel; set aside. Put the remainder of the vegetables in a large pot with the chicken stock, garlic, orange juice, apple cider, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cumin seeds, orange zest, salt and pepper. Cook the broth over high heat until reduced by about half. While the broth is simmering, remove the skin and excess fat from the leg of lamb and cut the meat into 1-inch cubes. Put the cubes on a wire rack to drain or on a clean towel to soak up excess moisture. Add some of the cooking oil to a large heavy skillet and heat over high heat. When the oil is hot, carefully add the diced lamb. Cook the lamb, in batches as necessary, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer the lamb to a roasting pan. Add the wine to the skillet that the lamb was cooked in and cook, over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook the wine until reduced by about half and the solids have come up off the pan. Pour the reduced wine over the lamb. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Strain the broth and discard the solids. Pour the broth over the lamb in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with a lid or parchment paper and braise until the lamb is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Once the lamb is tender, remove it from the oven and add the reserved roasted vegetables to the pan. Place the roasting pan over medium heat on the stovetop and bring to a simmer. Add salt, pepper, and fresh herbs, to taste. Serve the stew with rustic bread on the side. <|endoftext|>

 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 
 Pinch of kosher salt 
 4 Granny Smith apples, peeled and chopped into small pieces 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 50 chewy caramels, unwrapped 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 3/4 cup coarsely chopped macadamia nuts 
 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 Pinch of kosher salt 
 Vanilla ice cream, for serving

 Ingredients: 
 4 cups heavy whipping cream 
 2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 2 cinnamon sticks 
 1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise 
 2 teaspoons minced candied ginger 
 5 egg whites 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 2 cups blackberries, rinsed 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1/4 cup blackberry or raspberry liqueur 
 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped, as an accompaniment 
 Mint sprigs, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 To prepare the panna cotta: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 cup of the cream and the gelatin, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and vanilla bean. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until the gelatin has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, and whisk in the remaining 3 cups cream. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks. Scrape the seeds from the center of the vanilla bean into the cream mixture, and then discard the bean. Add the candied ginger, and whisk well. Let cool until tepid. In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, whip the egg whites at high speed until they hold soft peaks. Gently fold the egg whites into the cream mixture. Lightly butter eight 8-ounce ramekins. Divide the mixture among the ramekins. Chill, uncovered, for at least 4 hours, or up to 24 hours. To prepare the compote: Heat the butter in a large saute pan over high heat until melted and bubbly. Add the berries and saute for 2 minutes. Add the sugar and liqueur and cook until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. (Be careful: The liqueur may ignite. If it does, cool the berry mixture until the flames die down.) Add the ginger and cinnamon, mix well, and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer. Let cool for about 5 minutes. To serve: Run a knife around the sides of the ramekins, and turn each one over onto a plate to release the panna cotta. Top with about 1/4 cup of the warm compote and a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a mint sprig. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 large eggplant 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
 1/2 pound ground beef 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 onion, small diced 
 1 red pepper, small diced 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 1/2 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves 
 1/2 cup freshly chopped basil leaves, chopped 
 1 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano, divided 
 1/4 cup bread crumbs 
 1 egg 
 2 chopped tomatoes 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the eggplant in half and scoop out the center, leaving enough meat inside the skin so that it holds its shape when baked. Boil the scooped-out center part until very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium saute pan heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add the seasoned ground beef to the pan and saute until all of its liquid is evaporated and the beef begins to brown slightly. Drain the beef, removing the extra, unnecessary fat. Let cool briefly and chop the cooked beef so that there are no large chunks of meat. In another medium saute pan over medium heat add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and saute the onions, peppers and garlic together. In a bowl mix together the cooked eggplant, vegetables, cooked beef, herbs, 1 cup of the cheese, bread crumbs, and the egg. Fill the scooped-out eggplant halves with this mixture, dividing it evenly among the 2 halves. Top with chopped tomatoes and the remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese, season with salt and pepper, place on an oiled oven tray or baking dish, and bake for 50 minutes in preheated oven. Let cool briefly, slice widthwise and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Place the diced potatoes into a pot covered with cold water, set over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 12 minutes or until softened but still firm, drain, and spread out on a cookie sheet to cool quickly for 5 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the onion and cook to a light golden color before adding the blanched potatoes. Cook the potatoes and onions for 4 to 5 minutes or until the potatoes begin to brown. Add the julienned mushrooms to the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 additional minutes. Season the vegetable mixture with salt and pepper, remove using a slotted spoon, and add the cubed beef to the hot oil in one even layer. Brown the beef over high heat, turning only when one side has browned, and browning all sides evenly and quickly to maintain a medium rare interior. The beef should brown in approximately 7 to 8 minutes. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add the chili puree, tomato dice and cilantro. Add the cooked onion potato mushroom mix back to the pan and stir to combine. Press down along the edges so that a crust forms along the bottom. Turn the cooked hash out onto a plate and garnish with warm blanched sugar snap peas. Serve {optional} with poached quail eggs. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 
 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting and kneading 
 1/2 cup fine yellow cornmeal 
 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning 
 Kosher salt 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 Cooking spray 
 6 links andouille sausage (1 pound 2 ounces) 
 6 tablespoons shredded pepper Jack cheese or Cheddar 
 1 large egg, beaten 
 1/2 cup mayonnaise 
 2 tablespoons chopped cornichons 
 2 tablespoons grainy mustard 
 1 tablespoon ketchup 
 2 scallions, thinly sliced 
 2 teaspoons hot sauce 
 Instructions: 
 For the pigs in blankets: Combine 1/3 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees F) and the brown sugar in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, Cajun seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Add the flour mixture and the butter to the yeast, and mix with a fork until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a flour-dusted surface, and knead by hand until smooth, about 5 minutes, using more flour as needed. Coat the inside of a medium bowl with cooking spray; add the dough to the bowl, and cover. Let the dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Make a slit down the length of each andouille link, cutting about halfway through, and stuff each with 1 tablespoon shredded cheese. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into an 8-by-18-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut lengthwise into 8 strips. Discard the 2 outer strips with the most uneven edges. Wrap a strip of dough around an andouille link, coiling the strip from 1 end of the link to the other, leaving a 1/4-inch space between dough turns and leaving the ends of the sausage slightly exposed. Set on the prepared baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining dough and andouille. Brush the tops and sides with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. For the remoulade sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the mayonnaise, cornichons, mustard, ketchup, scallions and hot sauce in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve: Cut each pig in a blanket into 4 pieces with a serrated knife. Serve with the remoulade sauce on the side. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups sugar 
 2 tablespoons water 
 1/2 lemon, juiced 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 1 cinnamon stick 
 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 
 3 large eggs 
 2 large egg yolks 
 Pinch salt 
 Instructions: 
 To make the caramel: have ready a 2-quart round flan mold and a large roasting pan. Combine 1 cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan. Place over medium-high heat and cook until the sugar begins to melt. Swirl the pan over the heat until the syrup darkens to a medium amber color, about 10 minutes; don't stir with a spoon. Remove from the heat and immediately add the lemon juice, swirl the pan again to combine, and then pour into the flan mold. Tilt the dish so that the caramel evenly coats the bottom and a bit up the sides, place in the roasting pan and set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, bring a kettle of water to a boil for the water bath and keep it hot. Combine the cream, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium-low flame. Bring the cream to a brief simmer, stirring occasionally. Take care not to let the cream come to a full boil to prevent it from spilling over. In a large bowl, cream together the whole eggs and yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar; add a pinch of salt. Whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and thick. Temper the egg mixture by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture; don't add it too quickly or the eggs will cook. Pass the mixture through a strainer into a large measuring cup to ensure that the flan will be perfectly smooth. Pour the custard into the caramel-coated mold. To create the water bath: pour the hot (not boiling) water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the mold; be careful not get water into the custard. Carefully transfer to the middle oven rack, and bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until the custard is barely set and just jiggles slightly. Let the flan cool in the water bath, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to serve, run a knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the flan. Place a dessert plate on top of the flan and invert to pop it out. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 2 cups oatmeal 
 2 cups brown sugar 
 1 cup butter or margarine 
 4 cups your favorite fruit, cut into pieces if necessary 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat a grill. Combine flour, oatmeal, sugar, and butter in a large bowl; mix until well combined. Place 3/4 of mixture along the bottom of a Dutch oven. Spread fruit over top, then sprinkle with the rest of the oatmeal mixture. Place on rack of hot grill; 1/3 of the charcoal must be on top and 2/3 of the charcoal must be on the bottom. The key to cooking it is not to open the Dutch oven until you have smelled the cobbler for 10 minutes. Every time you open the Dutch oven you lose the heat. Serve warm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 large cloves garlic, smashed 
 2 tablespoons chili powder 
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 1/2 cups ketchup 
 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 
 1/4 cup yellow mustard 
 1/4 cup molasses 
 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 2 4-to-5-pound racks pork spareribs 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Make the sauce: Combine the garlic, chili powder, cayenne, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. Whisk the ketchup, 1 cup water, the vinegar, mustard, molasses, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic mixture and cook, stirring, until the oil turns brick red, about 1 minute. Add the ketchup mixture and bring to a gentle simmer; cook, whisking occasionally, 30 minutes. Make the ribs: Soak 1 heaping cup hickory, mesquite or apple-wood chips in water, at least 30 minutes. Prepare a grill for indirect cooking over medium-low heat (about 250 degrees F): On a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; on a gas grill, turn on only one side of the burners. Cover the grate on the cooler side of the grill with aluminum foil. Close the grill lid. Position the ribs on a cutting board, meat-side down. Slip a small knife between the bone and membrane, then gently pull off the membrane. Sprinkle the racks with 1 teaspoon each salt and black pepper on both sides. Drain the wood chips. For a charcoal grill, scatter the chips directly over the hot coals; for a gas grill, put the chips in a smoker box and position over direct heat. Put the ribs meat-side up on the foil on the cooler side of the grill. Close the grill lid; bring the temperature back up and cook the ribs, undisturbed, 3 hours. (For a charcoal grill, adjust the vents, or add more hot, ashed-over coals as needed to maintain consistent heat.) Remove the ribs and close the lid. Wrap each rack tightly in foil, then return to the cooler side of the grill, meat-side down; close the lid and grill 2 more hours. Remove the ribs and carefully unwrap. Return to the cooler side of the grill, meat-side up; cook, basting generously with the sauce halfway through, until the meat is tender, about 1 more hour. Remove the racks and let rest a few minutes before slicing. Serve with the remaining sauce. Photograph by Con Poulos <|endoftext|>

Add the flour mixture using the low speed, then mix in the chocolate chips and caramel candies. Drop the dough onto your baking sheets using a 1 1/2-inch (1/2-ounce) ice cream scoop. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart. Press down on the dough balls to flatten them to about 3 inches around. Pop in the oven and bake until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for a couple of minutes, and then let cool completely on wire racks. Now to make the ice cream sandwiches. Line baking sheets with foil. Use a 2 1/2-inch ice cream scoop to drop the ice cream onto the flat half of half your cookies. Cover the ice cream with the remaining cookies. Get the ice cream oozed out to the edges of the cookies by pressing them together gently. Roll the sides of the ice cream sandwiches in the crushed pretzels, making sure the pretzels stick. Place on the prepared baking sheets lined and freeze until ready to serve, at least a half hour. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 cup milk 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 3 lavender flowers, fresh or dried 
 2 eggs 
 Instructions: 
 In a small, heavy saucepan, combine cream, milk, sugar, and lavender.

 Ingredients: 
 4 cups heavy cream 
 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 
 Pinch of salt 
 8 egg yolks 
 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 16 teaspoons turbinado sugar for glazing (see note) 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. In a medium saucepan cook the cream with the vanilla bean and salt over moderate heat until the surface begins to shimmer. In a large heatproof bowl, blend the egg yolks and granulated sugar with a wooden spoon. Slowly add the hot cream mixture, stirring gently. Strain the custard into a large measuring cup; skim off any bubbles. Arrange 8 shallow 4 1/2-inch wide ramekins in a roasting pan (see note). Slowly pour the custard into the ramekins, filling them almost to the top. Set the roasting pan in the center of the oven and carefully pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan loosely with foil and bake for about 1 hour, or until the custards are firm at the edges, but still a bit wobbly in the center. Transfer the ramekins to a wire rack to cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Preheat the broiler. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet and blot the surfaces of the custards to remove any condensation. Using a small sieve, sift 2 teaspoons of the turbinado sugar over each custard in a thin, even layer. Broil the custards as close to the heat as possible until the sugar is evenly caramelized, 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve at once. NOTE: If using deeper 3/4-cup ramekins, bake the custards for about 20 minutes longer and reduce the sugar topping to 1 teaspoon per custard. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 large lemons 
 5 1/2 pounds plum tomatoes, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces 
 4 cups light muscovado sugar or packed light brown sugar 
 4 teaspoons ground cumin 
 Kosher salt 
 2 scant teaspoons red pepper flakes 
 4 small cinnamon sticks 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
 8 1/8-inch-thick slices peeled ginger 
 Instructions: 
 Start with our step-by-step canning how-to. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the lemons in wide strips, leaving the bitter white pith behind. Squeeze the lemon juice through a strainer into a large, wide saucepan. Add the lemon zest, tomatoes, sugar, cumin, 4 teaspoons salt, the red pepper flakes, cinnamon sticks, cloves and ginger. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are juicy and the sugar dissolves, 15 to 20 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are dark and syrupy and a candy or deep-fry thermometer registers 220 degrees F, 40 to 50 minutes (the timing may vary depending on the juiciness of the tomatoes). Reduce the heat if the mixture starts to scorch. Discard the cinnamon sticks. Meanwhile, sterilize four 8-ounce canning jars and lids. Fill the jars with the tomato mixture, leaving 1/4 inch headspace, then seal and process. Photograph by Charles Masters <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
 6 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into small pieces 
 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice 
 2 pounds assorted apples (such as Gala, Fuji or Honeycrisp) 
 8 ounces thawed frozen mixed berries (such as blueberries, blackberries and/or raspberries; about 2 cups) 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
 Pinch of salt 
 1 large egg, lightly beaten 
 2 teaspoons turbinado sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Make the crust: Pulse the flour and salt in a food processor to combine. Add 2 tablespoons butter; pulse a few times until the mixture looks like cornmeal. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the cream cheese; pulse a few more times until the dough just comes together. Add the vinegar and 1 tablespoon ice water; pulse a few times until the dough is moist. Divide the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap. Shape each into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Peel the apples and slice about 1/4 inch thick; toss with the berries, granulated sugar, flour, vanilla, butter and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself. Add the filling. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into an 8-inch round on a lightly floured surface; slice into 12 strips. Brush the strips with some of the beaten egg. One at a time, twist the strips of dough and, working from the center of the pie outward, arrange the strips on the pie to make one continuous coil. Brush the top of the pie with the remaining beaten egg and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Transfer the pie to the hot baking sheet in the oven and bake 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling, 50 to 55 more minutes. (Tent with foil if the crust browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Photograph by Con Poulos <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 One 15-ounce can pumpkin puree 
 1 rotisserie chicken, skin discarded, meat shredded or chopped 
 1 stalk celery, finely chopped 
 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp 
 2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage, 3 to 4 leaves 
 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, 10 to 12 sprigs 
 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped 
 2 scallions, finely chopped 
 1/2 cup dried cranberries, chopped 
 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 1/2 cup shredded Swiss or gruyere 
 24 empanada wrappers, such as Goya discos 
 2 eggs 
 Sunny's Creme Fraiche Dipping Sauce, to serve, recipe follows 
 8 ounces creme fraiche 
 3 scallions, cut into thirds 
 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp 
 1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Frank's Red Hot Sauce 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, chicken, celery, garlic, sage, thyme, walnuts, scallions, dried cranberries and Hungarian paprika. Taste, making sure to get a bit of each ingredient in the sample. There should be a nice balance of sweet and savory; adding a nice pinch of salt can bring you to the right place. Stir before tasting again and adjust as needed. Once done with the salt, add a few grinds of black pepper. Add the cheese and stir to combine. Refrigerate until mix is firm and less sticky, about 20 minutes. For the wrappers: Wrappers should be packed with paper between each. Remove one wrapper at a time along with the paper and roll and flatten each slightly with a rolling pin. If not packed with paper, roll on a sheet of wax paper. Cut each in half to create 48 half circles. Fill one side of each half with a heaping tablespoon of filling and fold the empty side over the filled side to create a triangle with a curved edge. Then, using the tines of a fork, close both open sides by pressing them together with the top 1/2 inch of the fork. Repeat for the rest. In a small bowl whisk the eggs and 1 tablespoon water. Lightly brush one side of each bite and place the brushed side up on a parchment or nonstick aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes. Serve with Sunny's Creme Fraiche Dipping Sauce. In a food processor, add the creme fraiche, scallions, garlic and hot sauce. Taste the dip and season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Blend again and taste, seasoning again if needed. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving cold. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 small shallot, finely minced 
 1 stalk celery, tough strings peeled 
 1 radish, thinly sliced 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 
 5 ounces cold vodka, plus more for topping (Alex likes Stolichnaya) 
 5 ounces cold tomato juice 
 1 lemon, halved 
 1 teaspoon Angostura or Peychaud's bitters 
 2 teaspoons creamy horseradish (Alex likes Inglehoffer) 
 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce 
 3 drops hot sauce 
 Instructions: 
 Put the minced shallot in a small strainer and rinse under cold water. (This will remove some of the raw onion flavor and help the shallot retain its crunch.) Pat dry, then transfer to a small bowl and add the celery, radish, and salt and pepper to taste. Combine the vodka, tomato juice, the juice of one lemon half, the bitters, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce in a small pitcher and stir. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add some crushed ice to 2 chilled glasses. Don't overload the Bloody Marys with ice so the flavors remain intense, not diluted. Add a hearty spoonful of the shallot mixture, then pour in the tomato juice mixture, filling the glasses almost to the top. Add another spoonful of the shallot mixture. Top each drink with a splash of vodka, like a "floater," and a squeeze of the remaining lemon half. Serve immediately. Photograph by Stephanie Foley <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 4 pounds lamb shank, cut into 2-inch ossobuco 
 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1/3 cup flour 
 3 cloves garlic, smashed 
 2 stalks celery, chopped into 1/3-inch pieces 
 1 large carrot, diced into 1/3-inch pieces 
 1 onion, chopped 
 1/4 cup tomato paste 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 3 cups unsalted chicken broth 
 3 sprigs fresh thyme 
 1 bay leaf 
 1 sprig fresh rosemary 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley 
 1 teaspoon lemon zest (1 lemon) 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Heat the oil in a large braiser set over medium-high heat. Dry the lamb very well and sprinkle with 1 1/4 teaspoons of the salt. Dredge each piece in the flour and then shake off the excess. Add the lamb to the pan and sear on all sides until deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the lamb to a plate. Add the garlic, celery, carrots and onions to the pan and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until the vegetables begin to brown and the mixture is fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring often, to caramelize the paste, about 2 minutes. Deglaze with the wine and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the broth, thyme, bay leaf and rosemary. Nestle the lamb back in the pan and cover with the lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the lamb is soft and tender, 2 hours. Remove the meat to a plate and keep warm. Skim the fat from the surface of the sauce and remove the herb sprigs and bay leaf. Return the meat to the sauce and serve sprinkled with the parsley and lemon zest. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 eggs 
 Flour, for dredging 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup bread crumbs 
 2 eggs, lightly beaten 
 4 quails 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 tablespoon canola oil 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 1 clove garlic, minced 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 pounds/1 kg fresh spinach, washed and tough stems removed 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 1 shallot, chopped 
 1 clove garlic, minced 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 For the eggs: Cook the eggs in boiling water about 5 minutes for a soft-boiled egg. Drain and cool the eggs in icy cold water, and then remove the shell. Put the flour in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs in a separate bowl and the beaten eggs in a third bowl. Take the eggs and coat them in the flour mixture, then the beaten eggs, and finally the bread crumbs. Keep them in the refrigerator until ready to fry. For the quails: Using a sharp knife, slice straight down the breastbone of the quail to open the breast cavity. Remove the rib cage so you have a boneless breast attached to the bone-in legs and wings. Cook's Note: If the breast breaks away from the legs, which can happen with such a small bird, cook each portion separately. Alternately, you can ask your butcher to de-bone the quails for you. For the herb garnish: Mix the parsley, basil, thyme, garlic, and olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Season the quails with salt and pepper. In a large oven-proof saucepan, heat the canola oil on high heat and grill the quails in canola oil on all sides until brown. Finish cooking them in the oven for approximately 8 minutes. Keep the quails warm on a separate plate. For the creamed spinach: Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook for 15 seconds. Drain in a fine mesh strainer, pressing with a large spoon to release as much water as possible. In a small saucepan, heat the cream to a simmer and let it reduce by half, for about 10 minutes. Add the Dijon mustard and stir. Put aside. Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, stirring until soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, just until the liquid is released. Add the reduced cream mixture, season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Using a deep fryer, heat the oil to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Fry the eggs for about 1 minute, or just until the crust is lightly brown. For serving: Plate each portion with creamed spinach topped with a quail and garnished with the herb mixture. Finish the plate with the fried egg cut in half. <|endoftext|>

 1 cup frozen blueberries (unsweetened) 
 1 teaspoon honey 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Put all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 1 tablespoon butter 
 1 large onion, diced (2 cups) 
 1 large carrot, diced 
 2 sticks celery, diced 
 2 quarts beef stock 
 1/2 cup orange lentils 
 1/3 cup barley 
 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed 
 1 can roman beans, drained and rinsed 
 1 recipe Turkey Meatballs, recipe follows 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
 3/4 cup water 
 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 small onion, diced (about 3/4 cup) 
 2 cups dry broken-up white bread 
 1 cup milk 
 1 pound ground turkey meat 
 2 large eggs, well beaten 
 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup golden raisins, hydrated in warm water 
 1/2 cup pine nuts, slightly toasted 
 Flour 
 1 cup vegetable oil 
 Instructions: 
 Add the olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven and place over medium heat. Saute the onions, carrots and celery for 5 minutes. In a saucepan add beef stock and bring to the boil on a medium heat, once the vegetables have softened add the simmering stock to the Dutch oven. (We should never add a cold liquid to an already heated pot as it dramatically drops the heat and slows down the cooking process.) As the stock is at temperature, add the lentils, barley and stir the broth. Place the lid back on and let the mixture cook for 5 minutes. Then add the drained and rinsed beans and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the browned turkey meatballs to the stock. Meanwhile, begin making your dumplings. In a mixing bowl add the flour, salt, baking powder and Dijon mustard. Sparingly add the water to the mixture and fold mixture until it forms a dough. With 2 tablespoons mold your dumplings 2 inches in diameter then drop them into the already simmering turkey meatballs and bean soup. Cook together for an additional 25 minutes with the lid on. Once the dumplings have risen and expanded, serve! In a heated skillet add olive oil and onions. Slightly cook them for about 5 minutes (we want the onions softened not colored). Place into a bowl and let cool. Take the 2 cups of broken up bread and place into a bowl with the milk. Let the bread soak for 5 minutes. Squeeze and drain the bread then place it into a large mixing bowl. Add the turkey meat, beaten eggs, chopped parsley, salt, black pepper, golden raisins and toasted pine nuts. Fold all ingredients together. Do not over work the turkey meat. Fill a Dutch oven with vegetable oil and place on low heat. Dust a baking sheet with about an inch of flour. In your hands scoop up a two-finger portion of the turkey mixture and with the palm of your hands shape the balls a little larger than a golf ball. As you make the balls add them to the baking tray with the flour and roll them until evenly coated. Carefully add the meatballs to the oil and brown for about 6 minutes. Transfer turkey meatballs to a plate and set aside for bean soup. Pour excess oil into a bowl. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon yeast 
 2 cups warmed milk 
 1/4 cup butter, melted 
 1/4 cups sugar 
 4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 tablespoon salt 
 4 tablespoons butter, for cooking fish and shrimp 
 1/2 cup chopped cucumber 
 1/2 cup grated carrots 
 1/2 cup chopped celery 
 1/4 cup chopped black olives 
 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon lemon pepper 
 1 tablespoon dill weed 
 1 tablespoon dried parsley 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 2 pounds cod fish 
 2 pounds large shrimp 
 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar 
 1 cup lemon yogurt 
 4 slices bread 
 Instructions: 
 In a bowl, combine the yeast and warmed milk. Mix well and let sit for a couple of minutes until the yeast is foamy. Add the melted butter and sugar. Mix well. Add the flour and salt. Mix well. Turn onto a lightly floured board or counter top and knead well for approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Put the dough in a generously buttered bowl and cover with a clean towel. Let rise for 1 hour. Punch down and place the dough in a buttered 9 by 12-inch bread pan. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place into oven and bake for approximately 45 to 55 minutes. Ovens vary so keep an eye on your bread. Tap on the bottom of your bread, if there's a hollow sound, it is completed. If not, bake a couple of minutes more. Remove from oven, let the bread cool in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove and cool on a wire rack. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the cucumber, carrots, celery, olives, lemon juice, lemon pepper, dill weed, parsley, and salt to the skillet and mix well. Let those ingredients simmer while you dice the fish and shrimp into small pieces. Add the fish and shrimp to the skillet, mix well, and cover with a lid. Place bread on each of 4 plates. Check the fish mixture and add the cheese. Turn off the heat and cover with the lid. In a bowl, pour the lemon yogurt. Add the fish mixture to the lemon yogurt and mix well. Scoop the fish mixture onto the bread to your desired fullness. Serve immediately while the fish is hot. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 large golden beet, or 3 medium red beets (about 12 ounces), trimmed 
 1/3 cup olive oil 
 1 red jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced 
 1 tablespoon distilled vinegar 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/3 cup gorgonzola cheese, crumbled 
 1 cup baby arugula 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Wrap the beet tightly in foil. Roast the beet directly on the oven rack for 40 minutes, or until just tender when pierced with a knife. Unwrap, cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate until completely chilled. (The beet can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.) For the chile oil: In a small saucepan, combine the oil and minced chile, and set over medium-high heat. As soon as the chile begins to sizzle and turns orange in color, turn off the heat. Transfer the chile oil to a small bowl and cool completely. (The chile oil can be made 1 day ahead. Keep covered at room temperature.) Carefully peel the beet. Using a mandolin, set at 1/8-inch thickness, or a very sharp knife, cut the beet into paper-thin rounds. Arrange the beet slices overlapping on a large platter. Sprinkle the vinegar all over. Drizzle some of the chile oil (with the minced chile) all over the beets. Season the beet slices generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle all over with the Gorgonzola cheese. Garnish with the arugula and serve. <|endoftext|>

Lift the lobsters out of the water with tongs and drain in a colander. Place underside up on a work surface and, grasping firmly, split the tails lengthwise with a large knife. Drain off the excess liquid. Serve with melted butter and lemon wedges. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound calves' sweetbreads 
 4 teaspoons coarse salt 
 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 
 1 pound haricots verts, trimmed at the ends 
 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 
 3 tablespoons finely minced shallots 
 1/4 cup hazelnut oil 
 Salt to taste 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus additional to taste 
 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 1 pound wild mushrooms (assorted), cleaned and trimmed 
 1/2 cup flour 
 Fresh chervil for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Soak the sweetbreads in a large bowl of cold water for 3 hours, changing the water several times. Then remove the sweetbreads from the water and gently pull away as much of the outer membrane as you can, being careful not to tear the flesh. Soak the sweetbreads again for 1 hour, this time in a large bowl of cold water with 1 teaspoon of coarse salt. Remove from the water and peel away more of the membrane. Separate the sweetbreads into its 2 lobes. Fill a medium saucepan with 5 cups cold water, 1 teaspoon coarse salt and the white wine vinegar. Place the sweetbreads in the pan and slowly bring the water to a simmer over moderate heat (this should take about 10 minutes). Allow the water to simmer very gently for another 5 minutes. (The sweetbreads should be firm on the outside, but still give a little when squeezed). Remove sweetbreads and place them in ice water for 10 minutes to stop the cooking. Dry sweetbreads and place in a heavy loaf pan or a terrine lined with plastic wrap. Cover with another layer of plastic wrap. Place another heavy loaf pan or terrine on top to weigh down the sweetbreads, and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight. When ready to cook, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and cook haricots verts until they are crisp but slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Remove and reserve at room temperature. In a small bowl combine the lemon juice with the balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of the shallots. Slowly whisk in the hazelnut oil. Season to taste with salt and the additional black pepper. Reserve. Place 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add remaining shallots and saute, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, making sure the pan is not overcrowded. (It may be necessary to saute the mushrooms in 2 batches). Saute with a big pinch of salt, shaking the pan occasionally, until mushrooms are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove mushrooms from skillet and reserve. If there is liquid in the pan that the mushrooms have given off, boil it until it is reduced to 1 to 2 tablespoons and pour over the mushrooms. With a very sharp knife, cut the weighted sweetbreads into broad slices that are about 1/4 inch thick. Combine the flour, the remaining 2 teaspoons of coarse salt, and the 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper on a plate and mix well. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the skillet in which the mushrooms cooked, and place over high heat. Dredge sweetbread slices in the seasoned flour on both sides and add to hot oil. Saute, turning, until sweetbreads are browned and crispy on the outside, about 3 minutes. Remove. Toss reserved haricots verts and mushrooms together. Toss mixture with about half the hazelnut vinaigrette. Place one-fourth of the mixture on each of 4 plates. Nestle pieces of the crispy sweetbread slices among the haricots verts/ mushroom mixture, and drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over the sweetbread slices. Garnish with chervil.

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 can chipotle pepper in adobe sauce 
 10 serrano chiles, stemmed, rough chop 
 3/4 cup hot pepper oil (chili oil) 
 3/4 cup olive oil plus 3 to 4 tablespoons 
 1 red onion, small dice 
 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh garlic 
 1 tablespoon dry basil 
 1 tablespoon dry oregano 
 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 
 1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for sprinkling 
 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 
 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 
 1 green bell pepper, small dice 
 1 red bell pepper, small dice 
 1 yellow bell pepper, small dice 
 8 cups favorite tomato sauce 
 6 cups heavy cream 
 2 cups grated Romano 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1 to 1 1/2 pounds dried rigatoni noodles 
 2 pounds chicken breast, cut into strips 
 Shredded locatelli cheese, or favorite grated cheese, for serving 
 4 scallions, fine dice (retain for final garnish) 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the hot sauce: In a blender, carefully blenderize the chipotle peppers, serrano chiles and pepper oil. This stuff is hot! Be careful with splatter! Reserve. For the chicken: In a large braiser or saucepot, warm 3/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, black pepper, cayenne and red pepper flakes. Stir well and cook until the onions are translucent. Stir the fresh chopped bell peppers into the onion mixture. Stir to coat. Add the reserved hot sauce. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomato sauce, heavy cream, Romano and sugar. Whisk well! Lower the heat until the sauce slightly bubbles, and stir well. Turn the heat to low or off while sauteing the chicken strips and cooking the rigatoni noodles. When the sauce is nearing doneness, cook the rigatoni noodles according to package directions. I like to pre-cook my pasta for sauteed pasta dishes such as this. Pre-cooking rigatoni to near doneness, straining and holding at room temperature, or completely chilling down if holding for several hours or more and then dunking in hot, boiling water prior to sauteing works well. For the chicken saute, heat a large saute pan with the remaining olive oil. First, sprinkle the chicken strips with 1 teaspoon salt (more or less), and add to the hot olive oil, one layer at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan. Cook in batches if necessary. Add a dash of black pepper if desired. Flip and shake the chicken pieces around in the hot pan to sear all sides. Cook until opaque and lightly brown, about 4 minutes. Set aside. Toss the tomato sauce and chicken in a large bowl in half-batches, or altogether. Pour onto a serving platter or individual pasta bowls. Garnish with locatelli cheese and reserved fresh scallions. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 to 2 cups leftover rice 
 1 cup leftover stir-fry 
 1 large egg 
 1 cup panko 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
 Instructions: 
 Place the cold rice in a bowl. Drain or pat your cold stir-fry to get as much of the sauce off as possible. (We like to use Orange Chicken.) Chop up the stir-fry into small pieces. There can be a mixture of rice and veggies. Add it to the bowl of rice. Crack an egg over the top and stir everything together. Now it's time to get messy. Get your hands in the bowl and roll little balls of your mixture. When you have a small ball, roll to completely coat in the panko. Heat up the oil in a pan and fry the balls until crispy. In another small saucepan, mix the soy sauce and vinegar. Simmer on low for 15 minutes. Serve the arancini with the dipping sauce. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
 Kosher salt 
 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 
 1/2 cup low fat plain yogurt 
 1 sleeve (about 25) saltine crackers, crumbled 
 1 cup toasted wheat germ 
 1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted, optional 
 Ranch Dipping Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 
 1 1/2 cups low fat yogurt 
 1 tablespoon garlic powder 
 1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt 
 2 shakes hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 
 2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley leaves 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the chicken breasts on the diagonal into wide flat strips and season with salt, to taste. In a large bowl, combine the Dijon and the yogurt, toss in the chicken and stir to coat evenly. Pulse, pulse, pulse the crackers in a food processor until they look like fine crumbs. Add the wheat germ and toasted almonds and pulse until it is a homogeneous mixture. Put this mixture into a wide flat dish. Roll the marinated chicken in this mixture, 1 piece at a time, pressing the cracker/wheat germ mixture to evenly crust each piece. Lay the prepared chicken onto a sheet tray fitted with a rack. Baking the chicken on a rack will allow the air to circulate around the chicken to cook it evenly and make it crispy. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through but not dry, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven to a serving platter and serve with the Dipping Sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Dip the chicken fingers in this and say yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmyy! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note) 
 2 teaspoons ground ginger 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 
 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 
 10 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 
 1 1/4 cups dark brown sugar 
 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 large egg 
 1/4 cup molasses

 Ingredients: 
 Vegetable oil cooking spray 
 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 
 2 teaspoons dried oregano 
 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed 
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1 large clove garlic, minced 
 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 6 slices Genoa salami (2 ounces), chopped 
 4 thin slices prosciutto, chopped 
 4 slices provolone cheese (4 ounces), chopped 
 4 large pepperoncini, stemmed, chopped 
 4 oil-packed sundried tomato halves, chopped 
 Four 6-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
 4 cups baby arugula (about 4 ounces), lightly packed 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Special equipment: 12 (10-inch-long) pieces of kitchen string Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Spray a heavy baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside. For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk the red wine vinegar, oregano, fennel seed, mustard, salt, pepper and garlic. Gradually whisk in the oil. For the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine the salami, pepperoncini, prosciutto, provolone and tomatoes with 1/4 cup of the dressing; toss to blend evenly. Place the chicken breasts, smooth-side down on the work surface with the thickest part at the top and the straight side on the left. Using a very sharp knife and starting on the right side, cut each chicken breast almost in half horizontally (stopping close to the left side), creating a pocket for stuffing. Open the chicken breasts like a book. Mound a fourth of the stuffing onto the right side of the breast, and press firmly to compact. Fold the left side (flap) of the chicken tightly over the stuffing. Lay three 10-inch pieces of string on the work surface 1 to 11/2 inches apart. Place the chicken on the strings and tie the strings around the chicken at intervals to keep the flap closed over the stuffing. Press in any stuffing pieces that fall out. Place the chicken breasts on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Roast until the chicken is cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a sheet of foil. Let rest 5 minutes. For serving: Divide the arugula among four plates. Cut the strings off the chicken. Cut each breast on a slight diagonal into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Fan the slices of one breast over the arugula on each plate. Drizzle with the dressing and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 
 2 teaspoons minced garlic 
 1/4 cup finely diced red onion 
 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses 
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon canola oil 
 16 small Hawaiian sweet rolls or potato rolls 
 1/2 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced paper thin 
 Mint Aioli, recipe follows 
 Fresh mint leaves, for garnish 
 4 cloves garlic 
 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 
 2 egg yolks, organic if possible 
 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 
 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder 
 1/4 cup extra light, extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat a grill to indirect heat, low setting, approximately 325 degrees F. In a medium bowl, add the lamb, garlic, red onion and feta. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix well with your hands. Form the mixture into 16 small patties (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 1 1/4-inch thick). Use your index finger to press a shallow dimple into the center of each patty. Cover and place in the refrigerator until ready to grill. In a small bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar, pomegranate molasses and soy sauce. Oil a paper towel with the canola oil and wipe down the grill grates several times to well coat with the oil. Immediately place the patties on the grill (dimple-side down) and cook for 8 minutes. Turn over, baste the tops with the balsamic mixture and cook for 4 to 6 minutes more (or to 130 degrees F for medium rare and 140 degrees F for medium). Remove from the grill and place on the Hawaiian sweet rolls or potato rolls. Add 2 slices of cucumber and a teaspoon of the Mint Aioli. Serve garnished with mint leaves. Mince the garlic, and then sprinkle the salt on top, and continue to mince and smash the salt into the garlic to form a paste. In a small bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, blend the yolks, garlic paste, lemon juice and mustard powder. Slowly add the olive oil to the yolk mixture in a very slow steady stream until the mixture is emulsified. Add the fresh mint and pepper and pulse until incorporated. Refrigerate. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 
 3 ounces finely chopped semisweet chocolate 
 3 ounces finely chopped unsweetened chocolate 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/8 teaspoon fine salt 
 3 large eggs 
 1 1/2 cups sugar 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 8 ounces cream cheese, softened (the microwave for 45 seconds at 50 percent power is a great way to do this) 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1 large egg 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, so that the edges of the paper come up the sides. Lightly butter the paper. Put both the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates and the butter in a heatproof medium bowl. Fill a medium saucepan with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat; set the bowl of chocolate over the water to melt. Whisk until smooth. (Alternatively, melt in a microwave at half power, for 1 minute, stir and then heat for another minute or until melted.) Whisk the flour and salt in a bowl. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla. Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and mix until just blended. Take care not to over mix the batter. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. For the marble swirl: Whisk the cream cheese with the sugar, egg, and vanilla until smooth. Drop very large spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture onto the surface of the brownie batter. Insert a butter knife through the batter to the bottom of the pan. With the flat edge of the knife, make swirling motions through the batters, occasionally lifting the knife through the top, until the dark and light batters are marbled. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out coated with a fudge-y crumb, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the brownies in the pan on a rack. To take the brownies out of the pan, lift the edges of the paper. Cut the brownies into squares. Serve. Copyright 2003 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 loaf Classic Pound Cake, recipe follows, see cook's note 
 1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream 
 6 egg whites 
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 6 ounces sugar 
 Melted butter, for brushing loaf pans 
 1 pound unsalted butter 
 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
 1 pound sugar 
 1 pound eggs, about 8 large 
 1 pound cake flour 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 Slice the pound cake loaf into 1/2-inch slices. With a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut pound cake into 6 individual portions and place on a cookie sheet. Place a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of each round cake. Freeze cake and ice cream until very hard, at least 1 hour. While the ice cream freezes, make your meringue: Preheat the oven to broil and place a rack 8 inches from the top of the oven. In an electric mixer with the whip attachment, on medium speed, beat together the egg whites and cream of tartar to soft peaks. Continue to beat and add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Whip until meringue has reached stiff peaks. Place meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Remove the ice cream from the freezer. Quickly pipe the meringue evenly over the ice cream, covering completely. Place in the broiler and broil just until tops are browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the inside of 2 loaf pans (9 by 5 by 3-inch) with melted butter. Line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper and brush again with butter. Reserve. Using a mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the butter and vanilla extract until creamy, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 10 to 12 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one. Lower the speed to stir and add the flour and salt. Mix until well blended. Pour half of the batter into each prepared loaf pan. Bake the cakes for about 1 hour, until the top is golden brown and a bamboo skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer pans to a rack and cool for 10 minutes. Then, remove cakes from the pan and allow to cool further on the rack. Serve slightly warm or use as needed. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cup whole milk 
 1-ounce fresh yeast 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 2 eggs 
 2 ounces butter 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/4 pound Gorgonzola Piccante 
 Extra flour, for dusting 
 2 cups Marcona almonds 
 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped 
 2 to 3 tablespoons good quality olive oil 
 1 pinch cayenne pepper 
 Salt 
 1 pound baby beets 
 3 tablespoons finely diced shallots 
 3 tablespoons finely diced chives 
 1/4 cup good quality olive oil 
 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 
 Fleur de sel 
 Instructions: 
 For the starter: Heat the milk up slightly so that it is just warm to the touch and pour into a bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the milk and then mix in the flour. The dough will be quite thick. Cover the bowl with plastic and let it sit in at room temperature for about an hour. For the dough: Scrape the starter dough in the bowl of a mixer. Add the eggs, butter, sugar, salt and flour and mix with your hands or spatula until the ingredients are loosely incorporated. This is messy and again the dough will be rather thick. Mix on low with the paddle attachment until the dough is silky and shiny. This will take at least 5 to 7 minutes and you will need to scrape down the bowl several times at first. Scrape the dough off the paddle attachment and form into a rough ball inside the mixer bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and let sit for an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Punch down the dough. For the bombolino: With slightly floured fingers, using about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dough, flatten the dough into a small disk about 1/4-inch thick. Place about 1 teaspoon of the cheese in the center and wrap the dough around the cheese. Pinch the dough together so that it sticks together and then roll the dough into a small ball. It is very important to make sure the dough is seamless, so that when it cooks no melted cheese escapes. Repeat until you have as many bombolino as you have salads. You will have excess dough. Heat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F, or heat up 2 inches of oil in a high-sided heavy-bottomed pan. Make sure the oil does not come up past the half way point of the pan. Frying bombolino, only a few at a time for about 2 to 4 minutes, until golden brown all the way around. You might have to turn them over as they do tend to float. Drain on a paper towel and eat while warm. For the almond butter: Place almonds and garlic in a food processor and puree until smooth, scrape down the sides of the processor as necessary. Add 1 teaspoon of the oil as needed. Be very careful about how much oil to add as the almonds will get smoother the more they are processed. Use only as much as needed to achieve a smooth but thick almond paste. Season with cayenne pepper and salt, to taste. Place in a container. Will last refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reseason as needed. For the beet salad: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim tops and tails of beets and wash. Place in roasting pan and add enough water to pan so that it reaches half up the side of the beets. Cover with aluminum foil and place in preheated oven. Check doneness after about 45 minutes. If a pairing knife is able to penetrate the beet very easily, the beets are cooked. Check a few to make sure. If they not ready, recover with foil and place back in oven. Check in 15 minute increments. Remove from oven and remove foil. Let them sit until they reach room temperature. Do not discard the water. Using a kitchen towel (that you are not afraid to get really messy), peel the skin off the beets. The skin should wipe off very easily. To get off any little pieces of skin you might have missed, rinse in the water they were cooked in. Once all the beets are peeled, discard skins and the water they were cooked in. Cut beets in quarters or thirds, depending on their size and your preference. Mix gingerly with shallots, chives, oil and vinegar. To plate: Smooth about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the almond butter on the plate. Place about 1/2 cup of the beet salad onto the almond butter. Place a freshly fried bombolino on top of the beets and season with a touch of fleur de sel. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 2 large egg yolks 
 1 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 7 to 8 tablespoons water 
 1 large egg white, lightly beaten 
 1 recipe potato, cheese, or sauerkraut filling 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 6 tablespoons butter 
 1 medium onion, finely chopped 
 3 large potatoes, boiled and mashed 
 4 ounces farmer's cheese 
 2 slices Colby or other mild Cheddar cheese, grated 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
 Smothered onions or sour cream (accompaniments) 
 2 cups farmer's cheese 
 1 egg yolk 
 3 tablespoons sugar for sweet vareniki, salt to taste, for savory 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla sugar for sweet vareniki (optional) 
 Sour Cream (accompaniment) 
 Confectioners' sugar (accompaniment) 
 3 strips bacon, diced 
 1 large onion, chopped 
 3 1/2 cups packaged (not canned) sauerkraut, rinsed and squeezed thoroughly 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 1/3 cup chicken or meat broth 
 Instructions: 
 In a food processor, blend the flour and the salt. With the motor running, add the egg and the oil, and then pour the water in a slow, steady stream until the dough forms a ball around the blade. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 2 minutes, until smooth. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 2 balls. On a floured surface, with a floured rolling pin, roll out one of the balls very thinly, to about 1/16th of an inch, making sure that it doesn't tear. With a cookie cutter, or a cup, cut out circles about 3 inches in diameter. Place a heaping teaspoon of the desired filling in the middle of a circle. Fold the dough over to form a semi-circle. Brush the edges with the egg and press firmly with the tines of the fork to seal. Place the vareniki as they are made on a large, lightly floured, platter, and cover with a damp cloth, while making the next batch. Repeat with the second ball of dough. Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate and carefully lower half of the vareniki into the water. Boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface, about 6 to 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the vareniki into a colander and drain thoroughly. Transfer into a deep serving bowl and toss with half of the butter.; In a small skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and saute the onion until deeply colored, about 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients. Add the Sauteed onion along with the cooking fat and mix well. Fill the vareniki and cook as directed.; In a large skillet, saute the bacon over medium heat until it renders its fat. Remove the bacon and drain all but 2 tablespoons of fat. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until nicely browned. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the sauerkraut and saute, stirring until limp and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature before filling. Use the reserved bacon for topping.; Combine all the filling ingredients and mix thoroughly. Fill and cook as directed. This filling can be either sweet or savory, so add salt or sugar, accordingly. Serve with sour cream and confectioners' sugar, if sweet. . <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 thin salmon fillets 
 3 flounder fillets 
 8 sea scallops 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 
 Salt and pepper, for seasoning 
 Canola oil, for brushing 
 4 ounces butter (1 stick), at room temperature 
 1 teaspoon dry parsley flakes 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 On your counter top lay out a sheet of parchment paper and top it with a layer of plastic wrap. Lay out your fillets of salmon, tails away from you. Overlap the fillets of flounder about 1-inch over the tails of the salmon. Then place the scallops on a metal skewer and set at the end of the flounder furthest from you. Sprinkle the herbs over the fish and season with salt and pepper. Using the plastic wrap pull the fish towards you so that the plastic begins to pull the flounder over the scallops. Be sure not to roll the plastic into the fish roll. Use a sheet pan to push the roll tightly as you pull the plastic toward you. The roll should be tight and you should be able to remove the sheet of plastic. Then roll the fish in the parchment away from you so it is covered and can be place into the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 1 hour. For Compound Butter: In a large bowl using a wooden spoon mix all ingredients. Place the mixture on a piece of parchment and fold the parchment over itself. Pull to form a roll and twist the ends. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to set up. Slice into 1/4-inch rounds and remove the parchment. Preheat your broiler and place the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element. Remove the metal skewer and slice the roulade into 3/4 to 1-inch rounds. Place onto a broiler pan and brush each round with canola oil. Put under the broiler for 3 to 6 minutes depending on how well done you like your fish. Serve with 1 slice of compound butter on each fish roll. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 small ripe melons 
 1 "golden" pineapple 
 2 bunches grapes 
 1 pint fresh figs 
 1 pint raspberries 
 1 pint strawberries 
 1 pint blueberries 
 1 red papaya 
 Instructions: 
 I like to begin the platter with a base of ripe, colorful, sliced melons and pineapple--for example, cantaloupe, honeydew, Galia, or Cavaillon melons, plus the new "golden" pineapples. Peel the outside of a whole melon, cut it in half through the stem end, and scoop out the seeds. Place the melon halves cut side down on a board, and slice them straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan each half-melon out slightly and arrange it on the platter. Next, cut off the top and bottom of the pineapple, peel the outside, and use a sharp knife to remove the "eyes." Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and remove the core by cutting a "V" down the center of each half. Again, place the pineapple halves, cut side down, on a board and slice them straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan the slices out and arrange them next to the melon on the platter. Once the base is set, you can add any kind of fruit that's available. I like to have one thing that is taller than the rest, such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively cut papaya, to give the platter height. Then I add raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and fresh figs in casual but organized groups. The platter can look like a bowl of M&M's if there are too many colors scattered with no order. Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and to be able to see each type of fruit. After all the fruit is arranged, I add flat green leaves around the outside of the fruit, to set off the colors. Use lemon and galax leaves from your florist, or fig leaves and grape leaves from your garden. Make sure they are pesticide-free and well washed. Any kind of fruit will work well on this platter. For special occasions, add persimmons, kiwi, passion fruit, Queen Anne cherries, fresh apricots, and mangos. Choose whatever is colorful and seasonal. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound blanched almonds, coarsely chopped 
 3 large egg whites, room temperature 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 4 teaspoons vanilla 
 3 to 4 cups confectioners' sugar 
 1 pound marzipan paste, at room temperature 
 Food coloring, for decorating 
 Cloves, for decorating 
 Instructions: 
 In an electric coffee grinder, grind the blanched almonds in small batches into a fine powder. Sift the powder through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Regrind any almond particles remaining in the sifter. In a bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy, whisk the vanilla, and stir the mixture into the almond powder. Sift in 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, kneading the mixture together in the bowl, and sift enough of the remaining 1 cup sugar to form a smooth, pliable dough (add more sugar if the dough is too sticky). Quarter the dough and wrap each piece tightly in foil. The marzipan paste keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.; Work with 1 piece of marzipan at a time, keeping the remaining marzipan covered tightly. Pull off a piece of marzipan paste, form it into a smooth ball by rolling it between the palms, and shape it gently into the desired shape. (Wipe hands occasionally with a damp cloth.) To achieve the texture of citrus fruit roll the marzipan shape over a fine grater or sieve. A small wire loop may be pressed into the back of the thickest part of the marzipan if the marzipan is for hanging. Let the marzipan dry on sheets of foil overnight and with a large soft watercolor brush dipped in the food coloring, tint it as desired. If a shading effect is desired add the second coat of coloring before the first coat dries. Let the marzipan dry on foil for 2 days and with a fine soft water color brush dipped in the food coloring add any fine details desired. Wooden picks, broken into small pieces and colored with food coloring, may be used to form the stems of fruits. Cloves may be used to form the blossom end of fruits such as apples and pears. White paper may be cut and colored with food coloring to form the leaves for fruits, or any small leaves may be used. After the marzipan has had its final coat of food coloring let it dry on sheets of foil for1 day. The marzipan keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks. Yield: 25 small marzipan shapes <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 5 pounds apples 
 1 cup apple cider vinegar 
 1 cup apple cider or juice 
 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, tightly packed 
 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup fresh ricotta 
 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 8 to 10 fresh sage leaves, very thinly sliced 
 Splash of milk or half-and-half 
 Kosher salt 
 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves 
 Freshly ground pepper 
 8 slices prosciutto di Parma 
 EVOO, for drizzling 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 1 cup panko 
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped 
 A few handfuls arugula (1 bunch), stemmed 
 4 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced lengthwise 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, sage and milk and season with salt. Butterfly each chicken breast, cutting horizontally into the thickest part of the breast almost all the way through to the other side (keeping the breast attached on one side). Open each breast like a book and pound to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick using the flat side of a meat mallet. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Place a spoonful of the ricotta mixture in the center of each chicken breasts, then fold the chicken over to enclose the filling. Wrap each chicken breast with 2 slices prosciutto, overlapping them slightly. Wrap each chicken breast in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Unwrap the chicken breasts and place on a rimmed baking sheet or shallow baking dish. Drizzle with EVOO, then bake until the chicken is cooked through and the prosciutto is crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. While the chicken bakes, heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the panko and thyme and cook, stirring, until the panko is golden. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano. Divide the chicken among plates. Arrange the arugula alongside the chicken and top the arugula with the tomatoes and garlic breadcrumbs. Cook's Note: The stuffed chicken breasts can be refrigerated for up to 2 days before cooking. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter 
 Pinch salt 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 eggs 
 Pinch ground cinnamon 
 4 ounces semisweet or dark chocolate 
 1/4 cup heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 1 tablespoon corn syrup 
 1 good pinch ground cinnamon 
 High-quality vanilla, coffee or dulce de leche ice cream, for filling 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the profiteroles: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water, the butter and the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the flour all at once and stir it vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture has formed a ball with a slightly sweaty sheen to it, and has pulled away from the pan. Transfer to a mixing bowl and let cool for 3 to 4 minutes; the mixture does not have to be cold, just cool enough not to cook the eggs when added. Using an electric mixer, or lots of good old-fashioned elbow grease, beat in the eggs one at a time; do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated. Add in the cinnamon and beat for another second to combine. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip, and pipe 1-inch balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Be sure to leave at least 1 inch between each of the balls¿they grow! When done, dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry bag released the dough. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through to ensure even cooking. When done, the puffs should be light, airy and dry inside. Cool on a rack. For the chocolate sauce: Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Put the chocolate in a metal or heatproof glass mixing bowl and place on top of the saucepan with the boiling water. Pay careful attention that the mixing bowl does not touch the surface of the boiling water. Add the cream, butter, corn syrup and cinnamon and stir until the chocolate has melted and everything is combined. This is a pretty quick process. Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the double boiler set-up. When ready to serve, cut the profiteroles in half horizontally and fill them with ice cream. Top with warm chocolate sauce. <|endoftext|>

Add the chocolate shavings and whisk until smooth. In another bowl, mix together the yolks, brown sugar, and cayenne. Slowly spoon the chocolate mixture into the yolks. Cook's Note: It is important to take your time with this step because the chocolate is hot, and if you dump it into the eggs in one shot you'll end up with chocolate scrambled eggs. Pour the mixture into little pots or espresso cups and cover with foil. Pierce some small holes in the foil so steam can escape and place the jars into a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with water halfway up the sides of the jars so that they bake evenly. Bake for 35 minutes. Cool the pots on the counter for 35 minutes and then put them in the refrigerator for 3 hours to chill. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Four 1 1/2- to 2-inch-thick pork chops, bone-in 
 2 ounces crumbled feta cheese 
 1/2 cup chopped frozen spinach (thawed and well drained) 
 2 tablespoons chopped kalamata olives 
 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes 
 Canola oil 
 Salt and pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: 4 wooden skewers, soaked to prevent burning Heat an outdoor grill or grill pan over medium heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Carefully make a slit into the side of each pork chop using a chef's knife to create a pocket to stuff ingredients into. Mix together the feta, spinach, olives and sun-dried tomatoes in a medium bowl. Stuff each pork chop with the spinach mixture and rub each with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Secure each pork chop with a wooden skewer or toothpicks (remember to remove before serving). Brush oil on the grill grate to prevent sticking. Grill the pork chops until nicely browned, 6 to 8 minutes, turning every few minutes to create grill marks. Transfer to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 to 12 pound leg of lamb 
 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black peppercorns 
 2 tablespoons coarsely ground white peppercorns 
 2 tablespoons coarsely ground green peppercorns 
 1 tablespoon coarsely ground Szechuan peppercorns 
 Fleur de sel or gros sel 
 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil to cook, plus extra to rub lamb 
 8 large new potatoes, washed, unpeeled and quartered 
 2 large yellow onions, large dice 
 3 large carrots, peeled and sliced 
 10 to 12 smashed garlic cloves 
 1 tablespoon minced thyme 
 Salt and black pepper, to taste 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 cup fresh lime juice 
 1/2 cup water 
 1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
 4 minced serrano chiles 
 1 cup mint chiffonade 
 2 limes, zested 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat large, roasting pan in a 550 degree oven. Rub lamb with olive oil. Generously salt (gros sel) the lamb. Mix the peppercorns together and pat on lamb. (This should be done at least 4 hours in advance, preferably overnight). In a large bowl, mix together potatoes, onions, carrots, garlic and thyme. Add oil, season and mix well. When pan is hot, pull out and dump veggies into the pan. There should be a good sizzle. Mix the veggies around and roast for 10 minutes. Mix again and place lamb on top. Place in oven and roast until brown, about 20 to 30 minutes. Turn oven down to 375 degrees, cover the lamb with foil to prevent burning and roast another 20 to 30 minutes. I shoot for medium rare, about 130 degrees. Mix veggies a couple of times during the cooking. Place lamb on a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Make sure the veggies are fully cooked and check for seasoning. If not, place back in oven another 10 minutes. Serrano Chile-Mint Jelly: In a non-reactive pan, dissolve sugar in juice and water. Pour 2 tablespoons of the warm liquid in a small saucepan and add gelatin. Dissolve on low heat and set aside. Raise to medium-high under the first saucepan and add the chiles, mint, zest and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook for 10 minutes, occasionally stirring. Remove from heat and add dissolved gelatin. Store in refrigerator overnight, stirring occasionally to break up the gelatin. It will be a soft jello-like consistency.; <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 to 3 ripe beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 
 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves 
 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar (preferably aged) 
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
 Salt and ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Arrange tomato slices on a plate. Layer with basil leaves. Drizzle vinegar and oil. Sprinkle salt and black pepper over top. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 medium-size yellow onion 
 4 tablespoons butter (1/2 stick) 
 5 cups or more chicken broth, canned or homemade 
 2 cups Arborio rice (available in many supermarkets or specialty food stores) 
 Salt and pepper to taste 
 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
 Instructions: 
 Preparing the Rice Peel and finely chop the onion. Melt the butter in a 4-to-5-quart saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly. Add the onion and cook, continuing to stir, until it turns soft and translucent. Turn the heat down if the onion starts to brown. Meanwhile, pour the chicken broth into a separate saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a gentle simmer. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain this simmer the whole time you are preparing the risotto. Once the onion is soft, add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary -- if the rice is cooked at too high a heat, it will turn brown and take on an undesirable flavor. Adding the Liquid to the Rice Using a ladle, scoop up about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broth. Pour it in the pan with the rice, stirring constantly with a spoon. After the first addition of broth, the rice mixture will look a bit soupy. As the rice begins to cook, stir it constantly, making sure that you scrape along the bottom of the pan so that it does not stick. You should see little bubbles popping up on the liquid from time to time. If it bubbles more vigorously than this, turn the heat down to medium-low. When most of the liquid is absorbed into the rice and the rice begins to look a bit dry, add another ladle of broth to the pan and stir constantly, as before. Determining When the Risotto Is Cooked Continue to add the broth in 1/2-to-3/4-cup batches and stir the rice until you have used most of the broth (this will probably take about 20 minutes). It is now time to test whether the risotto is cooked. Spoon up a grain of rice and bite into it -- it should be tender without being too mushy. If it is still crunchy and tastes a bit starchy, you will need to continue adding liquid and cooking further. If it looks as if you will run out of chicken broth and your rice is still not cooked, don't be alarmed. Because of variations in individual stoves and cooking temperatures, you may need more liquid than called for in the recipe. Simply heat up another cup or 2 of chicken broth. If you run out of broth, use hot water. When the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency, almost like thick oatmeal, it is done. Serving the Risotto Add salt and pepper to the risotto, about 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until it seems well seasoned to you. Stir. Add the grated Parmesan cheese and stir well. Serve the risotto immediately in warm bowls and have extra grated Parmesan on hand. Risotto with Tomatoes and Basil: Take 4 Roma tomatoes, cut off and discard the stem tops, and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Chop enough fresh basil leaves into small pieces to make about 1 cup. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand 1 inch from the bottom, add the tomatoes and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Stir for 3 or 4 minutes, until they seem soft. Put the cooked tomatoes aside, and when the risotto is done, stir the tomatoes and basil into the hot risotto. Stir to mix well; taste for salt and add some if needed. Serve immediately and pass some grated Parmesan cheese. Risotto with Spinach and Garlic: Peel and chop 3 large cloves of garlic into small pieces, and put them on a piece of waxed paper. Rinse 1/2 bunch of spinach leaves, and shake off the excess water. Cut off the stems, bunch the leaves up, and cut them into thin strips, then cut crosswise into small pieces. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand, palm side down, 1 inch from the bottom of the skillet, it is ready. Add the garlic to the oil and stir for a minute. Turn the heat to low, and add the spinach. Press the spinach down with a spatula, lightly salt and pepper it, and turn it over with a spatula. The spinach will wilt down almost immediately. Take the skillet off the stove, put a lid on the skillet, and when the risotto is done, stir the garlic and spinach into the risotto. Serve immediately, and pass some grated Parmesan cheese. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound white chocolate chips 
 1/2 cup chopped semisweet chocolate or semisweet chocolate chips 
 12 white chocolate-coated truffle balls, such as Lindt 
 12 black licorice gumdrop candies, for hats, or twelve 1-inch pieces rope licorice 
 36 colorful mini candy-coated chocolates, for buttons, plus 24 mini candy-coated chocolates, for earmuffs, optional 
 12 pretzel sticks or chocolate-covered pretzel sticks, broken in half 
 12 small orange sprinkles or other tiny orange candies, such as Tic Tacs 
 6 multicolored sour gummy belt candies 
 Confectioners' sugar, for serving, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a piping bag with a small #2 or #3 plain tip or a resealable plastic bag Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the white chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave at 50 percent power for 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until it is completely smooth. Melt the semisweet chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave at 50 percent power in 15 second intervals, stirring after each until it is completely smooth. Transfer to a piping bag with a small plain tip (#2 or #3). (Alternatively, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Spoon 12 ovals of white chocolate onto the parchment for the melted snowman bodies, leaving several tablespoons of white chocolate behind in the bowl. Top each oval with a truffle for a head. (If the truffle has a flatter side, attach it facing up for the hat decoration option, so the hat will adhere. If you are making the earmuff option, place the more rounded side up.) For the hat decoration: Cut each licorice gumdrop in half crosswise. Lay the flat disc-shaped piece on a flat surface and use the heel of your hand to flatten it into a larger disc shape. Attach the other half of the licorice back onto each using the sticky sides to adhere to each other. Dip the bottom of the licorice candies in the reserved white chocolate and attach to the tops of the truffles for hats. For the earmuff decoration: Spread white chocolate on the rope licorice and attach to the truffles for earmuff headbands. Dot white chocolate onto the mini candy-coated chocolates and attach to the sides of the truffles to make the earmuffs. For the body and face decoration: Stick the pretzel pieces into the white chocolate for arms and arrange some of the mini candy-coated chocolates down the center for buttons. With scissors, cut the gummy belts in half lengthwise, trim the ends to make scarves and set aside. Spread a little white chocolate on the orange candies and attach for noses, holding in place until the chocolate hardens. Pipe the semisweet chocolate on for the eyes and mouth. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Wrap the gummy scarves around the snowmen and pinch to attach at the front. Serve immediately or keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Dust the melted snowmen with confectioners' sugar if desired. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pint vegetable broth 
 1 1/2 pounds 21 to 30 size deveined shrimp with shells on (you can use smaller shrimp if you like, but these are easy to clean and still economical) 
 2 cucumbers, peeled, seeds removed, and diced large 
 2 ripe tomatoes, seeds scooped out (leave pulp intact) and diced large 
 1 teaspoon minced fresh jalapeno, stem and seeds removed and diced (protect your hands and eyes and avoid breathing in the fumes of any hot peppers) 
 1 small red onion, diced 
 2 tomatillos, diced 
 1/2 cantaloupe, seeds removed, scooped from rind and diced 
 1/2 honeydew melon, seeds removed, scooped from rind and diced 
 1 fresh lemon, halved and seeds removed 
 2 tablespoons chopped chives 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan. You will be using it as a court bouillon - a poaching liquid for the shrimp. The court bouillon is not actually part of the soup. Poach the shrimp in their shells until just pink and remove to a platter to cool. (Shrimp cooked in its shell retains more flavor). While the shrimp are cooling, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, tomatillos, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon in a food processor and pulse to coarsely chop. Remove to a bowl and squeeze in the juice of the fresh lemon, being careful not to drop any remaining lemon seeds into the mix. Add the chopped chives, and stir to combine. Peel the shrimp and finely dice. Stir the shrimp into the fruit/vegetable mixture and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Chill well. In the episode, we served this gazpacho as an hors d'oeuvres in porcelain Chinese spoons. You can do the same or be creative by using your own choice of individual serving vessel such as sake cups, rice bowls or even 2 ounce ramekins with demitasse spoons. It can also be served as an appetizer in soup bowls. <|endoftext|>

Lay salmon piece on top of halibut, directly in the middle. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 1/4th of the crab and Brie mixture in the middle of the salmon. Do this with all 4 pieces of fish. Take plastic wrap that the fish is laying on and wrap fish into a tight roll, twisting the ends to make a "tube". Refrigerate. Toss yams, roughly chopped garlic, thyme sprigs and olive oil in a bowl until completely coated. Season with salt and pepper. Spread evenly on a sheet pan and roast in a 350 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. While yams are roasting combine Riesling and 2 tablespoons shallots in a small saucepan. Reduce by 3/4 over medium-low heat. Whisk in butter a little at a time until completely combined. Once all the butter is beaten in, remove from heat and season with salt. When yams have about 10 minutes left to finish, take fish rolls from the refrigerator and slice each roll into 3 or 5 equal sections. Remove plastic wrap after cutting and lay shingled out on well greased sheet pan and put into oven with yams. When yams are done, fish should be done as well. While fish and yams are cooking, heat saute pan with 1 tablespoon whole butter. Once hot, drop mushrooms into pan and saute over medium-high heat until crispy and tender. Season with 1 tablespoon shallot, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, salt and pepper, to taste. Remove yams and fish from oven. Place a 3 or 4-inch ring mold in center of plate and fill with roasted yam hash, pressing down firmly. Remove ring mold. Place mushroom mixture on top of yam cake, allowing it to spill slightly over the side. Take fish roll and shingle in front and up yam cake, creating some height with the back piece of fish. Drizzle 1-ounce Riesling butter over front edges of fish slices. Garnish with 2 chive sprigs and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened 
 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 
 1 tablespoon grated orange zest 
 1 tablespoon peeled, grated fresh ginger 
 2 cloves garlic, finely minced (about 2 teaspoons) 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1 whole chicken (4 to 5 pounds), giblets removed, trimmed of excess fat, rinsed and patted dry 
 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes (about 8), sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds 
 1 tablespoon sunflower oil 
 Instructions: 
 In a small bowl, combine the butter, cardamom, orange zest, ginger, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Butterfly the chicken: Place on a cutting board, breast-side down with the neck toward you. Using a pair of sharp kitchen shears (and your biceps), cut through the bones on either side of the backbone; the spine should come away in a narrow strip, which you can discard or save for stock. Flip the bird over, breasts facing up and closest to you. Using the heel of your palm and your body weight, push down on the breastbone; you should hear it crack. The chicken should lie flat now. Rotate the drumsticks toward the center line of the body so she looks a little knock-kneed. There you go. You just butterflied a chicken! Slide your fingers between the flesh and the skin over the breasts, thighs and drumsticks. Use a teaspoon to deposit a little of the flavored butter into each pocket and smooth it out over each part of the chicken, making sure the butter is evenly spread, then pat the skin dry. Toss the potato slices with the sunflower oil, season with salt and pepper and let them sit in a bowl at room temperature alongside the chicken for 30 minutes. Give your oven a quick wipe down before preheating it to 500 degrees F. (The high temps will cause any leftover drips to smoke you out of your kitchen! If your oven still smokes, then turn it down to 450 degrees F after the first 10 minutes.) Drain off the water that's been drawn from the potatoes and pour the potatoes into an even layer in a large cast-iron skillet. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and tuck the wings under her shoulders. Pop the whole kit 'n' kaboodle into the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Rotate the skillet and cook for 20 more minutes, until the skin is crispy, the juices run clear and the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the chicken from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board, loosely tented with foil. Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, gently turn the potatoes. If you'd like them crispier, pop them under your broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Scoop out the potatoes onto a platter, leaving behind the pan grease. Cut the chicken into pieces, place them on top of the potatoes and serve with boldness and courage! Find more recipes from Aarti in her cookbook, Aarti Paarti ($28, Grand Central Publishing).

 Ingredients: 
 Generous 1/2 cup water 
 Pinch salt 
 Pinch granulated sugar 
 3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed 
 1/2 cup bread flour 
 2 to 3 large eggs 
 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 Scant 2/3 cup light corn syrup 
 Scant 1/2 cup water 
 Instructions: 
 How to Make a Cornet, method follows Make the centerpiece: Use a marker to trace the shapes of the centerpiece on a sheet of parchment paper in a sheet pan. Depending on how well you space your drawing for the entire centerpiece, you will need 4 to 5 set ups of parchment paper lined sheet pans. Starting with the centerpiece layers, draw 3 round bases of gradual size: draw the first circle 8 inches in diameter, the second circle about 5 inches in diameter and the third circle about 3 inches in diameter. Fill each circle by drawing a crosshatch pattern spacing your lines 1/2 to 3/4-inch apart. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag with a 1/4-inch straight tip and trace the base shapes you drew. To make the supports for the base: Using the same technique used to trace the 3 round bases, draw 5 curled lines that resemble a decorative letter S about 6 inches tall. These will sit between the largest and middle-sized base. Then make the same shape in a smaller size, about 3 inches tall, you will need 3 of the smaller S shapes. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Trace the S shapes with the piping bag filled with the pate a choux. To make the butterflies: begin by making the butterfly wings, draw the shape of a teardrop about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long. Draw a second tear drop, the same size as the first, they should be connected, round end to round end in order to create a wing shape. Draw 10 sets of wings, this will give you 5 butterflies. Place more pate a choux in a paper cornet (see How to Make a Cornet). Trim the tip so you can draw a very fine line. Trace the outline of the butterfly wings with the pate a choux. Then, in a freeform style, draw a narrower teardrop shape within the boundaries of each of the larger teardrops. Make sure the smaller teardrops connect with the larger teardrops at both ends. To make the body of the butterfly, using the same cornet, pipe 2-inch strips making a thick end (the head) and gradually tapering off. To make the antennae simply pipe a 1 1/2-inch V shape. You will need 5 sets of bodies and 5 sets of antennae. Bake the pate a choux in the oven at 320 degrees F for about 20 minutes. How to Make a Cornet: The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. Prepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, set it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer set on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. To make the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until light golden brown. Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl to hold the temperature of the sugar. Put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect your hands from the heat of the glass. Assemble the centerpiece: The caramel acts as glue. Dip the bottom of the first large S into the caramel and stick it to the largest base going from the out side rim of the circle, towards the center of the circle. In other words, the base supports should almost meet each other in the center of the circle. This creates a structure for the next layer to rest on. You will have to hold each S support in place in order for the caramel to harden and actually stick, keeping the S shape in the right position. Repeat using the other 4 pieces, spacing them evenly. Dip the bottom of the first small S into the caramel and stick it to the medium-sized base. Repeat using the other pieces, again spacing them evenly. Place the medium size base on the large S supports. Top the small S supports with the smallest base. You will have a 3 tiered structure. To assemble the butterflies: using the caramel as glue, connect 2 sets of the wings together. Do this along length of the wings. Adjust the wings to sit at a slight angle, as though the wings are in mid-flight. Do this with all 10 wing sets, creating 5 total butterflies. Using a paring knife dipped in the caramel to spread it might be easier than dipping the wings or bodies in the bowl of caramel. You may need to prop the wings up while they harden. You can do so using 2 rolling pins or 2 thick books lying with about 2 inches between them. The space between them is where the glued center juncture will rest on the work surface and you will be able let the wings harden on a slight angle; this way you will not have to hold them in place until they harden. Using more caramel, glue the bodies to the area where you glued the wings together. Place the fatter end of the body at the top section where the wings are joined. Glue the antenna to the fatter part of the bodies. If at some point during the gluing process the caramel has become to stiff to use; place the caramel in the microwave oven at 30-second intervals, until it loosens up for you to use it again. Once the butterflies have been assembled and the caramel has hardened, you can then glue them wherever you like on the 3-tiered centerpiece. Place the centerpiece on a large tray. Display the Bomboloni and the Cloud Puffs around the centerpiece. Voila! <|endoftext|>

 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 1 1/3 cups (2 2/3 sticks) salted butter 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1 teaspoon lemon zest 
 1 teaspoon lime zest 
 2 large eggs 
 3 tablespoons whole milk 
 4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Topping: 
 One 8-ounce package cream cheese 
 1/3 cup powdered sugar 
 Zest of 1/2 lemon 
 Apple Jelly Glaze: 
 1/2 cup apple jelly 
 Grilled Fruit: 
 Coconut oil, for oiling the grill pan 
 10 strawberries, hulled 
 4 kiwi fruit, peeled and quartered 
 2 peaches, quartered 
 1/2 pineapple, skinned, cored and cut into 1/4-inch slices 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: 8 metal or wooden skewers For the cookie crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream the granulated sugar, butter, vanilla and lemon and lime zests thoroughly. Add the eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Add the milk and mix. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Blend the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Divide the dough in half, flatten into discs and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze for 20 minutes. Roll out the 2 pieces of dough and put each one on a baking sheet. Bake until the cookie dough is cooked and golden brown but not overly crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely. For the topping: Using a mixer with a whisk attachment, whip together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and lemon zest in a medium bowl until light and fluffy. For the apple jelly glaze: Mix the apple jelly and 3 tablespoons water together in a bowl. For the grilled fruit: Heat a grill pan to medium-high heat and oil with the coconut oil. Thread the strawberries, kiwi, peaches and pineapple slices separately onto skewers (there should be about 2 skewers per type of fruit) and lay them onto a plate. Brush with the apple jelly glaze. Turn the skewers over and brush the other side with more glaze. Grill the fruit, turning once, until grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the fruit from the skewers, placing each type of fruit into individual bowls. Serve the cooled crusts with the cream cheese topping, bowls of grilled fruit and the remaining apple jelly glaze. Let everyone build their own pizza by spreading the cream mixture on the crust and decorating with as much fruit as desired, finishing with a final brushing of the apple jelly mixture for gloss! <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 ounces pancetta, finely chopped 
 10 cloves garlic, minced 
 Grated zest of 3 lemons 
 Grated zest of 1 orange 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 Leaves from 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped 
 Kosher salt 
 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes 
 2 tablespoons rinsed capers, chopped 
 1 10-to-12-pound skin-on boneless fresh ham, butterflied 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the pancetta in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until it forms a paste. Transfer to a bowl and mix in by hand the garlic, citrus zests, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes, capers and 2 tablespoons salt until thoroughly blended. Put the ham flesh-side up on a cutting board and score the meat with the tip of a sharp knife every inch or so in a cross-hatch pattern. Rub the pancetta paste into the meat, making sure to get it into the score marks. Flip the ham over and score the skin with the knife as you did the flesh. Roll the ham up skin-side out and secure with kitchen twine. Season the skin lightly with salt. Put the pork in a roasting pan and transfer to the oven to roast for 2 hours. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and roast until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 170 degrees F and the skin is nice and crisp, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 30 minutes. Thinly slice the porchetta before serving. Photograph by Yunhee Kim <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 cups flour 
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2/3 cup vegetable oil 
 2 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk 
 1 cup sugar 
 Zest of 1 lemon 
 Juice of 1/2 lemon 
 Juice of 1/2 orange 
 2 tablespoons brandy 
 Raspberry or apricot preserves, or Poppy Seed Filling, recipe follows, for filling 
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
 1/2 cup raisins 
 3/4 cup fresh poppy seeds* (see Cook's Note) 
 1/2 cup milk 
 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar 
 Pinch salt 
 1/4 cup honey 
 1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1/2 teaspoon of the juice 
 1 slightly beaten egg 
 Instructions: 
 In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the oil, eggs, egg yolk, sugar, zest, both juices and brandy until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until a sticky dough is formed. Wrap in plastic wrap, flatten into a disk and chill overnight. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Working with about one quarter of the dough at a time and leaving the remaining in the refrigerator, roll on lightly floured surface a little less than 1/4-inch thick. Cut circles (or other fun shapes) using cookie cutters 2 1/2 to 3 inches. Place a spoonful of filling in center (about 1 teaspoon per cookie) and then pinch one side up. Turn and pinch second and then third to make a triangular shape. Leave a little bit of the filling showing at the top. For non-traditional shapes, use your imagination: tubular, squares, bite-size or even some flat cookies depressed in the center with a bit of filling there. Place cookies on parchment paper on cookie sheet, brush with a little beaten egg for sheen and bake until nicely browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Keep room temp in airtight container but consume within 3 to 4 days, tops. Combine everything except the lemon zest and juice and the beaten egg into a saucepan and cook over moderate heat until thick, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir often. Add zest and juice. Take a bit of the filling and mix it into the beaten egg. Repeat, then mix the egg mixture into the pot of filling. Cool overnight. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons/30 ml olive oil 
 1 onion, thinly sliced 
 8 ounces porcini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 
 1 jalapeno or serrano chile, seeded and minced 
 Salt and freshly ground pepper 
 A few sprigs of fresh cilantro or epazote 
 1 cup/250 ml harina de maiz azul (blue cornmeal) 
 1 cup/250 ml masa harina 
 1/2 teaspoon/2 ml salt 
 About 1 cup/250 ml warm water 
 1 cup/250 ml queso fresco 
 Salsa, for serving, optional 
 Instructions: 
 For the porcinis: Heat the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy frying pan. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and chiles and continue cooking until golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cilantro and set aside. For the blue corn tortillas: In a bowl, mix the harina de maiz azul, masa harina and salt with the warm water using a wooden spoon until a dough is formed, about 2 minutes. Let stand, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for 2 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 parts. Roll each part into a ball, keeping the balls you are not using in a plastic bag so that they don't dry out. (If the dough does get too dry, add a little extra water.) Place a ball on a sheet of plastic wrap and cover it with another sheet. Flatten slightly with the palm of your hand, and then finish rolling with a rolling pin, working quickly and lightly. Flip the package over and repeat until an approximately 6-inch circle is formed. Repeat with all the dough balls. Preheat a flat griddle or pan to high heat. Peel away the top layer of plastic wrap, flip the package over gently and peel away the other piece of plastic wrap. Transfer to the griddle. Bake on the first side for about 30 seconds. Flip and bake on the second side for about 30 seconds. Flip once again. Remove from the griddle and keep warm. To assemble, spread with a quarter of the cheese on 1 tortilla. Garnish with a quarter of the mushrooms and top with another tortilla. Place on the griddle, turn the heat down to medium-high and press down gently. Cook until the cheese begins to melt. Flip the quesadilla, and heat for another minute. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve with salsa if desired. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 12 ounces unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened, plus 1 tablespoon 
 16 ounces cake flour, plus 2 tablespoons 
 16 ounces sugar 
 4 large eggs, room temperature 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 cup whole buttermilk, room temperature 
 Instructions: 
 Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch aluminum tube pan or 2 (9 by 5-inch) loaf pans with 1 tablespoon of butter and dust with 2 tablespoons of the flour. Combine the remaining 12 ounces of butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and cream for 6 minutes on medium speed, using the paddle attachment. Stop once to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. With the mixer running at lowest speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Again stopping once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. This will take approximately 1 1/2 minutes. Add the vanilla and salt and beat on medium speed for 30 seconds. With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour in 3 installments, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour, making sure each portion is fully incorporated before adding the next. After the final addition, beat the batter for 30 seconds on medium speed until almost smooth. Scoop the batter into the prepared pan(s), dividing evenly if using 2 pans. Bake for 1 hour in a tube pan or in loaf pans, until the internal temperature reaches 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The crust will be golden brown and spring back when pressed, but the crack around the center will appear moist. Remove the cake from the oven to a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan(s) and cool on the rack for 10 minutes longer. Store the cake on the rack covered with a tea towel for up to 3 days. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 12- to 14-pound turkey, thawed if frozen 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1/2 onion, quartered 
 1/2 bulb fennel, trimmed and cut into chunks 
 1 apple, cut into chunks 
 3 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon chopped leaves 
 1 lemon, zest grated, halved 
 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter

Once slightly softened, scoop ice cream into a large pie pan and spread into an even layer along the bottom. Evenly place strawberry slices flat over the ice cream, pressing down lightly so they adhere. Put whipped topping in a bowl. Add pudding and mix thoroughly. Spread pudding/topping mixture into a smooth layer over the strawberries. Evenly place banana slices flat over this layer, and drizzle with chocolate syrup. Sprinkle with nuts and evenly place the cherries on top of the pie. Freeze for about 4 hours (or overnight), until completely firm. Allow the pie to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before slicing. Cut into 8 slices and enjoy! <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 1 (10-pound) bottom round roast 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
 1 (4-ounce) can mushrooms 
 1/2 cup of your favorite barbecue sauce 
 Dutch Oven Sourdough Biscuits, recipe follows 
 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for kneading 
 3 tablespoons baking powder 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 cup shortening 
 1 1/2 cups Sourdough Sponge, recipe follows 
 1/2 cup milk 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 cup water, used to cook potatoes in 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat a wood fire or outdoor charcoal grill to medium heat. In a Dutch oven, placed on the grill grate or directly on the embers of the fire, heat vegetable oil. Season roast with salt and pepper. Rub minced garlic all over surface of roast. When oil is hot, place roast fat side down in Dutch oven. Pour mushrooms over roast and cover. Cook with coals or embers on the lid and a small amount under the oven. Cook until meat shreds easily, about 12 hours, adding coals or wood as necessary to maintain a constant temperature. Shred meat with 2 forks and return to pot. Add barbecue sauce and mix well. Serve open-faced over Dutch Oven Sourdough Biscuits. Preheat a wood fire or outdoor charcoal grill to medium heat. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, rub shortening into dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Combine sourdough sponge and milk. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until dough no longer sticks to the side of the bowl. Turn dough out onto a floured countertop. Flour fingertips and knead about 12 to 15 times. Roll out dough with a rolling pin to a 1/2 to 3/4-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch round biscuit cutter (or an empty can or glass), cut biscuits and place in a large Dutch oven with sides touching. Bake with coals on the lid and a small amount under the oven until biscuits are puffed and golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Mix flour and water used to cook potatoes in. Let mixture stand in a warm place covered with a dish towel for 3 days, or until bubbly and sour smelling. This is your starter. Use as directed in recipe. <|endoftext|>

In a medium nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, cook chicken over medium heat until browned, about 2 minutes. Remove chicken from the pan. Pour the rice vinegar mixture into the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the mixture until it thickens to a syrup, about 6 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan and cook until chicken is fully cooked through, about 1 minute. Position an oven rack at the bottom of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Sprinkle the cheeses over the pizza crust, leaving a 1-inch border, and top with the chicken. Bake for 12 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with green onions. Place pizza on a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. In a small pot, warm the water to 100 to 110 degrees F. In a large bowl, dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water and let stand for 5 minutes. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups and level with a knife. Add flour, cornmeal, oil and salt to yeast mixture; stir until soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until even, about 5 minutes. Add bread flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray and turn to coat. Cover and let rise in warm place (about 85 degrees F) free from drafts until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Gently press 2 fingers into dough; if indentation remains, dough has risen enough. Punch dough down into the shape of a ball. Lightly re-spray bowl; place dough in bowl, turning to coat again. Cover; let the dough rise again in a warm place (about 85 degrees F) free from drafts for another 30 minutes. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 12-inch crust.

 Ingredients: 
 8 1/4-inch-thick boneless pork chops (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds total), trimmed of excess fat 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 6 thick slices white sandwich bread 
 3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 
 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary 
 3 large eggs 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for frying 
 5 cups baby arugula 
 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved 
 Lemon wedges, for serving 
 Instructions:

 Ingredients: 
 1 recipe Perfect Pie Dough (1 disk), recipe follows 
 1 pound (3 cups) fresh fruit pitted, sliced, and peeled, if necessary (recommended: cherries, berries, peaches, plums, apricots, pears, apples, rhubarb) 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 2 tablespoons flour 
 Spices and seasonings, to taste (recommended: zest, citrus juice, pure extracts, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, fresh herbs, etc.) 
 1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 1 large egg, lightly beaten 
 2 teaspoons sugar (recommended: turbinado sugar) 
 1 1/2 cups flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, chilled or frozen 
 4 to 6 tablespoons ice cold water 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Stir together the prepared fruit, 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and spices and/or seasonings in a large bowl until combined. On a well-floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a large circle, about 12 to 14 inches. Make sure the rolled dough is chilled. Spoon the fruit mixture onto the center of the dough leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the edges of the dough over the fruit, pleating the dough, then dot the fruit filling with the butter pieces. Lightly brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake the pie until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Cover the crust with foil if the crust browns too quickly. Cool. Serve the warm galette with ice cream. Cook's Note: The same recipe can be made in individual serving sizes. To make pie dough: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, mix together the flour and the salt; cut or work the butter into the flour with your fingers or a pastry blender until you have large pea sized chunks scattered throughout. Alternatively, pulse the dough in a food processor, or mix in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low speed. Add the ice water slowly while stirring with a fork, or in the food processor or mixer, until just combined. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Divide the dough into 2 disks, flatten and refrigerate each for at least 15 minutes. Roll out one chilled pie dough to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Reserve the second pie dough disc for another use. Transfer dough to pie plate, pressing the dough lightly into the plate; trim the edges. Dock the dough with the prongs of a fork evenly over the bottom of the pie plate. Line the docked dough with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the pie crust until the edges are brown and golden, about 15 minutes Remove from the oven and remove the weights. Return crust to the oven to finish baking for another 5 minutes. Rustic Pie/Galette Variations: Almond Apricot: Season the sliced apricots with almond paste or extract. Spiced-Apple Pear: Season the sliced apples and pears with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar. All-Berry: Fill the baked crust with pastry cream and top with sweetened berries. Caramelized Onion and Walnut: Caramelize 4 Spanish onions; let cool. Top the dough with grated Gruyere cheese and spread the onions and toasted walnuts over the cheese. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons chile powder 
 1 tablespoon ground coffee 
 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder 
 1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/4 teaspoon garam masala 
 1 (2-pound) flank steak 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 4 large onions, sliced very thinly 
 Kosher salt 
 4 dates, pitted and minced 
 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
 1/2 cup water 
 Vegetable or canola oil, for greasing 
 Instructions: 
 For the rub: In a small bowl, stir together the rub ingredients, making sure to smooth out any brown sugar nuggets. Then, pour half the mixture over 1 side of the flank steak and massage into the meat. Turn the steak over and pour the other half over the meat and massage in. Set aside on the counter up to 2 hours to marinate. You could also marinate the meat overnight in the fridge. For the compote: Heat the olive oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering (not smoking), add the onions, a pinch of salt, and stir to coat with oil. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn a deep caramel color, about 45 minutes. Warm your grill or grill pan over medium heat. When the onions are caramelized, add the dates, vinegar, and water. Stir and cook, covered, for another 15 minutes. Fold a paper towel in 4, pour a little vegetable or canola oil onto it, and wipe down your grill pan. Once the grill pan is nice and hot (oil lightly smoking), throw your rubbed-down meat on. It should sizzle upon contact - if it doesn't, your pan wasn't hot enough. This is how you ensure a nice crust on the steak! After 5 minutes on 1 side, flip the steak over, and cook another 4 to 5. Check the temperature; I like my flank steak done medium-rare, so I pull it off as soon as the thermometer register 125 degrees F. Pull onto a chopping board, and tent with foil; allow your meat to rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak thinly against the grain on the bias; if you don't, your precious steak won't be incredibly tender and deeply unsatisfying! Serve with a dollop of onion compote on top. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 200 grams whole-wheat flour, plus more for the work surface 
 200 grams emmer wheat flour (if unavailable, use whole wheat) 
 265 grams water 
 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil, plus more for the bowl 
 7 grams salt 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Bowl Plastic wrap Plastic dough scraper l0-inch cast-iron skillet Rolling pin Spatula (optional) Morning: Combine the flours, water, oil, and salt in a bowl until they come together into a mass. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes while the flour absorbs the water. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes by pushing down on and spreading the dough and then folding it over on itself. It should be smooth and elastic. Form it into a ball and place it in a clean, oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 4 to 8 hours. Afternoon or Evening: About 45 minutes before you want to bake, spread out the dough on a lightly floured counter, cut the dough in half with a dough scraper, and roll it into 2 logs. Cut each log into 6 pieces. You should have 12 pieces of dough that weigh about 55 grams each; evenly distribute any leftover dough. Shape each piece into a ball. Let the balls rest for 30 minutes at room temperature under plastic wrap. Place a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and let it heat up for several minutes. Meanwhile, liberally flour a work surface. Flatten a dough ball and dust it lightly with flour, then use a floured rolling pin to roll it out as thin as possible (7 to 9 inches in diameter), rotating the disk to keep it even. If it resists, let it rest for a few minutes and continue rolling again. Cover the disk with a towel. Repeat with the remaining dough. When the skillet starts smoking, gently lift a disk of dough. Place it in the skillet, cook it for about 30 seconds, and then turn it over with your fingers or a spatula for another 30 seconds. Remove the skillet from the flame and, holding the flatbread by its edge, put it directly on the fire. Keep moving it in a circle so that it doesn't burn, then turn over and repeat. The bread should be blistered and dark in spots. Remove the flatbread and cover it with a towel or aluminum foil to keep it from forming a crust. (Dot it with butter and fold it in half if you like.) Repeat with the remaining disks of dough. Serve warm. These can be made in advance and stored in a resealable plastic container on the counter for a couple of days. But they are best eaten fresh. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 24 pecan halves 
 24 mini pretzel twists 
 24 individually wrapped soft caramel squares, unwrapped 
 8 ounces good-quality milk chocolate, melted 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put the pecan halves on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake, shaking the sheet once halfway through, until lightly toasted, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a plate to cool.

 Ingredients: 
 6 eggs 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup flour 
 4 cups dark corn syrup 
 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2 cups chopped pecans 
 Pie Crust, recipe follows 
 1 cup unsalted butter 
 1 cup solid vegetable shortening 
 4 cups cake flour 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 3 teaspoons kosher salt

Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for 1 hour longer. The pie will rise up and form cracks on the top, and the filling will be set when baking is complete. Remove pie and let it cool before cutting.; Combine the butter, shortening, 2 cups of the cake flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Blend together. Stop mixer, scrape the sides and add remaining 2 cups of cake flour and remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Blend to combine completely. Mix sugar and salt into 1/4 cup of the water and add it to the flour mixture. Blend briefly and add the remaining water if needed. The dough should not be overworked and should make a solid piece when held in your hand. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured smooth surface and knead it several times. Divide the dough into portions and flatten it. Wrap unused dough in plastic. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Re-roll any scraps for a second pie crust. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with fork. Bake 12 minutes or until light brown. Cool on wire rack. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing the baking sheet 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Filling: 
 3 pounds peaches (about 6 peaches), cut into 1/2-inch wedges 
 1 1/2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar 
 Juice of 1 lemon 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
 Streusel: 
 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup sliced skin-on almonds 
 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: A rimmed 10-by-15-inch baking sheet Adjust a rack to the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a rimmed 10-by-15-inch baking sheet with butter. For the dough: Combine the butter, flour, confectioners' sugar and salt in a food processor and process until the mixture comes together in a solid mass (this may take a few minutes). Drop pieces of the dough all over the prepared baking sheet. Use your fingers to press the dough evenly along the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan, filling any gaps. Set aside. For the filling: Toss together the peaches, brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl until the cornstarch dissolves. Transfer the filling onto the crust and spread in an even layer. Bake for 30 minutes. For the streusel: While the pie bakes, make the strussel topping by combining the flour, almonds, brown sugar, melted butter and salt in a small bowl until evenly moistened. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the filling. Return the pie to the oven and bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes more. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let the pie cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 8 medium black tiger shrimp (about 12 ounces), peeled and deveined 
 4 slices smoked bacon (about 4 ounces), excess fat trimmed and discarded 
 1 tablespoon cornstarch 
 1 tablespoon finely grated peeled ginger 
 1 large egg, beaten 
 1 large scallion, finely chopped 
 Dash toasted sesame oil 
 Dash light soy sauce 
 Sea salt and freshly ground white pepper 
 3 slices firm good-quality white sandwich bread 
 1/4 cup white sesame seeds 
 3 cups peanut oil 
 Instructions: 
 Put the shrimp and bacon on a cutting board and using a large, sharp knife, mince them together until very finely chopped and scoop them into a mixing bowl. Add the cornstarch, ginger, egg, scallions, sesame oil, soy, and sprinkle of salt and white pepper and mix until very well combined.

 Ingredients: 
 2 (5-pound) boxes kosher salt 
 1 1/2 cups primary veal stock, recipe follows 
 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon rind 
 2 tablespoons capers, drained 
 1 small clove garlic, mashed 
 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1 head fillet of beef, about 2 1/4 pounds 
 18 to 20 fresh or canned grape leaves, thoroughly dried 
 6 small boleti or large shiitake mushrooms 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped 
 1 3/4 cups fresh Italian bread crumbs 
 3 paper-thin slices prosciutto, very finely chopped 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves 
 2 tablespoons chopped pine nuts 
 10 pounds veal breast or other meats 
 2 cups dry white wine, preferably Sauvignon Blanc, or water 
 10 quarts water 
 6 medium yellow onions, quartered 
 4 medium carrots, coarsely chopped 
 10 large leeks, white and green parts, well washed, coarsely chopped 
 1 center pale yellow celery rib with leaves 
 4 cloves 
 Large bouquet garni of 30 parsley stems, 2 large sprigs fresh thyme and 2 small or 1 large bay leaf 
 2 (1/2-inch) chicken bouillon cubes or 2 teaspoons salt 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the boxes of salt into a large braising pot and heat in the oven until unbearably hot to the top of the hand. Meanwhile, place the veal stock in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat and reduce to 1 cup. Add the lemon rind, capers, garlic, parsley and pepper, to taste. Keep warm in a hot water bath to prevent further reduction. Trim the fillet, removing all traces of fat and silver skin between the muscles. Tie the roast with fine string at 1-inch intervals. Blanch the fresh grape leaves for 1 second in boiling water so they can bend easily. Cool them, then remove their stems and central rib. Eliminate these steps if using canned leaves. Roll the meat into the leaves and tie at 1/4-inch intervals. Using a large measuring cup with a handle, remove 2/3 of the hot salt to a medium roasting pan. Arrange the meat on the bottom layer of salt and immediately cover it with the reserved salt, to cover completely. Turn the oven temperature down to 400 degrees F and roast about 25 minutes. Remove the meat from the oven when it reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F. Keep the meat wrapped in the leaves, and let rest 5 minutes. Remove all strings and leaves, slice, and serve with the caper sauce and the garnish of stuffed mushrooms. Prepare the mushrooms: Wash and dry the mushrooms; cut the edible part of their stems into 1/4-inch dice and set aside. Using a melon baller, remove all the foamy "tubes" inside the cap of each mushroom and discard them. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and sear the mushrooms 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove them to an ovenproof baking dish, hollow side up, and season with salt and pepper. Add the onion to the same skillet and cook until translucent. Adding more oil if needed, stir in the mushroom stem dice, bread crumbs, prosciutto, parsley, basil and nuts; mixing together until well blended and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until heated throughout. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon an equal amount of the mixture into each mushroom cap. Drizzle more olive oil over the top of each mushroom and bake 10 to 15 minutes in the same oven as the beef. Note: The USDA recommends that beef be cooked to an internal temperature of 130 degrees F, but Madeleine prefers to remove the fillet from the oven when its internal temperature has reached 110 degrees. The meat continues to cook as it rests, resulting in a fillet that is rare to medium-rare. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the meat into large chunks and remove as much fat as possible. Place the meat in a large roasting pan and roast until all the juices in the pan have browned to a deep golden russet color, about 45 minutes, careful not to burn the juices. Transfer the meat to a large stockpot. Discard the fat in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the wine, scraping up the golden brown glaze at the bottom of the pan. Add this to the stockpot together with the 10 quarts water. Bring to a boil, add the vegetables, cloves, bouquet garni, and bouillon cubes or salt. Return to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer about 4 hours or until broth has a rich beef flavor; skimming off any scum from the surface during cooking. It may be necessary to add warm water to the pot during cooking to keep the water level approximately even throughout cooking. Once the stock is finished cooking, remove from heat and allow to cool to a more manageable temperature, about 160 degrees F or higher. Strain the stock through a fine-meshed strainer either directly into storage containers or into a large bowl from which it can then be transferred into smaller storage containers. Once stock is in the storage containers, cool it down quickly by placing the containers into an ice water bath. Once cooled completely, cover and refrigerate. Keep containers refrigerated until all the fat has risen to the surface and hardened. To remove, break the solidified fat and discard. The stock is now ready to use. Keep refrigerated for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 6 months. To keep refrigerated stock longer, re-boil it every fourth day. Re-boil frozen stock for up to 5 minutes before using to prevent spoilage. Yield: 10 quarts <|endoftext|>

Shred the chicken with 2 forks, then return the shredded chicken to the liquid and simmer on low until everything is hot and bubbly. Assemble the nachos in 2 ways: Sprinkle a layer of tortilla chips onto 2 ovenproof plates or baking dishes. Sprinkle both with cheese and then a layer of chicken; repeat twice more with each layer getting smaller in circumference. Finish with an extra sprinkling of cheese. Bake just until the cheese melts, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve one dish as is. On the other, layer on the jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes, green onions and sour cream. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil 
 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
 1 large orange, zested 
 1 large lemon, zested 
 1/2 cup orange juice 
 1/4 cup lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
 2 tablespoons minced shallots 
 1 cup chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, firmly packed 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, firmly packed 
 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves, firmly packed 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 
 2 large jalapenos; stemmed, ribs and seeds removed, and minced 
 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 very large red bell peppers, seeds and ribs removed, cut into large julienne 
 2 very large yellow bell peppers, seeds and ribs removed, cut into large julienne 
 2 large cloves garlic, sliced thin 
 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 
 4 (8 to 10-ounce) swordfish steaks, 1-inch thick 
 Garnishes: orange zest, very thinly sliced jalapeno, 4 thin orange slices (then sliced in the middle to twist). 
 Warmed sourdough baguette slices 
 Instructions: 
 To prepare the chimichurri, place all the ingredients in a food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes until the ingredients are well combined. Can be used immediately, but for best results refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving, to allow to come to room temperature. Preheat your grill pan (or outdoor grill) over medium-high heat. Brush each sweet potato slice generously with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until tender when poked with a knife (you want some nice char marks on the potatoes.) You may need to grill in 2 batches. Place on a baking sheet, wrap with foil and place in a preheated to 200 degree F oven. Next, in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. When hot add the bell peppers and season generously with salt and pepper. Saute until caramelized, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Turn the heat off, toss in the toasted pine nuts, basil and oregano and add a pinch more salt and pepper. Stir to combine and keep warm on the stovetop. For the swordfish, again heat your grill pan (or outdoor grill) over medium-high heat. Brush both sides of the swordfish generously with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Grill until just cooked through, but still moist, about 3 to 4 minutes per side (being careful not to overcook the fish.) To plate, first put 1/4 of the sweet potato slices onto each of 4 warmed plates. Top potatoes with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a tiny pinch of salt. Next, top the sweet potatoes, with 1/4 of the bell pepper mixture. Then place the swordfish atop that, and spoon a generous amount of the chimichurri over the middle of the fish. To garnish, top the chimichurri with a tiny sprinkling of orange zest, then just a few very thinly sliced pieces of jalapeno, and a twisted orange slice. Serve with warmed sourdough baguette slices and the additional chimichurri on the side. Enjoy!! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (2 pound) flank steak 
 1 cup (jarred or canned) pickled jalapenos, including the onions and carrots that come in the jar or can 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 medium white onion, sliced 1/2-inch thick, keeping the rings together 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 4 poblano chiles 
 2 jalapeno chiles 
 1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced 
 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 
 Flour tortillas, guacamole and pico de gallo, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Marinate the flank steak in the pickled jalapenos, at room temperature, for 1 hour. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Season the steak with salt and pepper, to taste, and grill until nicely charred, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the grill and allow the steak to rest on a cutting board while preparing the rajas. Secure each piece sliced onion horizontally with wooden skewers. Brush both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill the onions, turning occasionally, until soft and charred, about 10 to 15 minutes. Put the poblano and jalapeno chiles on the grill and char them on all sides. Once the chiles are blackened on all sides, set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the charred skin, stem and seeds. Cut the chiles into strips. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, remove the skewers and separate the onions into rings. Preheat a large cast iron pan or a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Slice the flank steak, on the bias, into thin strips. When the pan is hot, coat the bottom of the pan with some olive oil. Add the sliced garlic and dried oregano, and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sliced steak, onions and chile strips to the pan to heat through. Transfer to a serving platter and serve piping hot with flour tortillas, guacamole and pico de gallo. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup flour, more as needed 
 1 cup panko breadcrumbs, more as needed 
 2 large eggs 
 2 tablespoons water 
 Vegetable oil, for frying 
 3 to 4 ripe, but not soft, medium Haas avocados 
 Coarse sea or kosher salt, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 If not serving avocado fries immediately, preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Place flour in a wide, shallow bowl and panko in another wide, shallow bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and water. In a deep, medium saucepan, heat 1 inch of oil to 375 degrees F, or until a few panko bits bubble vigorously when added.

Dip in egg wash, then panko, gently pressing breadcrumbs on sides to coat. Place avocados on large cutting board or plate. When oil is hot, fry 3 to 4 avocado slices at a time until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Gently transfer with tongs to paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle generously with salt. Place baking sheet in oven to keep warm, or serve immediately with lemon slices and salsa or other condiments, if desired. Repeat with remaining avocado slices. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 
 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 
 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 
 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 cup creme fraiche 
 2 green onions, dark green and pale green part, thinly sliced 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 large russet potatoes 
 1/2 cup clarified butter 
 1 clove garlic, smashed 
 3/4 teaspoon poppy seeds 
 3/4 teaspoon flaked sea salt 
 3/4 teaspoon sesame seeds 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Parsley leaves 
 Instructions: 
 For the onions: Put the red onions in a medium bowl. Combine the lime juice, vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from the heat and let sit to cool slightly, 5 minutes, then pour over the onions. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. For the hash browns: Mix together the creme fraiche and green onions in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Grate the potatoes using the large holes on a cheese grater. Heat half of the clarified butter in a 12-inch seasoned cast-iron pan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook until it is lightly golden brown on both sides and infuses the oil with the flavor of the garlic, then remove and discard. Toss the potatoes with the poppy seeds, salt, sesame seeds and some pepper. Add the potatoes to the pan and stir to coat with butter. Using a spatula, gently press the potatoes into a flat round, slightly smaller than the pan. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the edges are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Working carefully with some large, flat spatulas, flip the potato cake. Pour the remaining butter around the edges of the potato cake and continue cooking until potatoes are crisp on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Let cool for a few minutes. Spread the top with the prepared creme fraiche and scatter the pickled onions over the top. Garnish with parsley leaves and cut into wedges to serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3/4 pound turnips, cut into 1-inch pieces 
 3/4 pound carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces 
 2 teaspoons unsalted butter 
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Put the vegetables in a skillet just large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add enough water so that it comes halfway up their sides along with the butter and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, then adjust the heat to maintain a simmer. Cover the vegetables with a round of parchment paper just large enough to fit the inside diameter of the pan, or with a lid set ajar. Simmer the vegetables until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the cover and raise the heat to high. Toss the vegetables frequently in the pan, as the liquid evaporates to a shiny smooth glaze. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 
 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
 2 1/4 cups pecans 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 large eggs 
 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 
 1/2 cup molasses (not blackstrap) or sorghum 
 2 tablespoons bourbon 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 Make the crust: Pulse the flour, 2 tablespoons butter, the shortening, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until it looks like fine meal. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Drizzle in the vinegar and 2 tablespoons cold water and pulse until the dough just comes together. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form the dough into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months; thaw at room temperature.) Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate, fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge with your fingers. Chill at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and toast until darkened, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and return the empty baking sheet to the lower oven rack. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, until brown flecks appear, about 8 minutes; let cool slightly. Whisk the browned butter, eggs, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon and salt in a bowl. Scatter the toasted pecans in the prepared crust; pour in the brown sugar mixture. Put the pie directly on the hot baking sheet in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set, 45 to 55 minutes. (Cover the edge with foil if it is browning too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool at least 1 hour before serving. Photograph by Johnny Miller <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (8 to 10-pound) smoked ham, bone-in, skin on 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 bunch fresh sage leaves 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut in chunks 
 2 medium navel oranges, sliced thin, seeds removed 
 2 cups orange juice 
 2 cups light brown sugar, packed 
 1 cup water 
 1/4 teaspoon whole cloves 
 2 cinnamon sticks 
 1 1/2 pounds peeled baby carrots 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Put the ham in a large roasting pan, fat side up. Using a sharp knife, score the ham with cuts across the skin, about 2-inches apart and 1/2-inch deep. Cut diagonally down the slashes to form a diamond pattern; season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Chop about 8 of the sage leaves and put in a bowl; mix with the oil to make a paste. Rub the sage-oil all over the ham, being sure to get the flavor into all the slits. Bake the ham for 2 hours. Now there is plenty of time to bang-out the orange glaze. For the glaze: Place a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chunks of butter, oranges, orange juice, brown sugar, water, and spices. Slowly cook the liquid down to a syrupy glaze; this should take about 30 to 40 minutes. After the ham has been going for a couple of hours, pour the orange glaze all over it, with the pieces of fruit and all. Scatter the remaining sage leaves on top and stick the ham back in the oven. Continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours, basting with the juices every 30 minutes. Scatter the carrots around the ham and coat in the orange glaze. Stick the ham once again back in the oven and cook for a final 30 minutes, until the carrots are tender, the ham is dark and crispy, and the whole thing is glistening with a sugary glaze. Set the ham on a cutting board to rest before carving. Serve the carrots and orange glaze on the side. <|endoftext|>

Tear the bread into small pieces and scatter in the dish. In a large measuring cup or small bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until light. Add the milk and vanilla and whisk well. Pour over the bread evenly. Tamp down the bread with a spoon or spatula to submerge each piece in egg mixture. Cover with foil, gently pressing down so the foil is right on the surface of the mixture. Refrigerate overnight. The next morning, remove the dish and slide it into a cold oven with the foil on. Turn oven on to 350 degrees F. After 25 minutes, gently pull off and discard the foil. Continue to bake until pudding is puffed and golden brown, about 20 more minutes. In the meantime, prepare the spiced pears: melt butter in a wide frying pan (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat then add the pears. Stir until pears are coated well with butter, then sprinkle sugar, cinnamon, and a good pinch of fresh nutmeg; continue to cook about 3 minutes until pears begin to soften. Pour in 1/4 cup of maple syrup; cook until bubbly then remove from heat. To serve, spoon bread pudding onto plates and top with spiced pears. Pass additional maple syrup at the table. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup each 1/2-inch diced vegetables: yellow onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and tomato 
 1/2 cup roasted green chile, cut into a small dice 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying 
 4 cups chicken broth 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 
 1/4 teaspoon ground comino (cumin) 
 2 cups Enchilada Chicken, recipe follows 
 6 each white corn tortillas, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips 
 6 each blue corn tortillas, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
 Chopped cilantro leaves, as needed 
 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 
 Salt, as needed 
 1 cup crushed corn tortilla chips 
 Instructions: 
 Begin with a large pot. Saute the vegetables and chile briefly in about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes. When the vegetables are limp, add the broth and add the garlic and cumin and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add chicken, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile (or beforehand), fry the corn tortilla strips in 350 degree F oil for 2 minutes until crispy. Drain well on paper towels. At the Blue Corn Cafe, we always have tons of chips around so we used crushed ones for garnish on the bottom of the soup bowl...the strips are added at the top. We, of course, use white and blue corn tortillas. If for some reason the blue variety are not available where you live, I suggest you immediately draft a letter to your Congressman! Yes, you can use all white or yellow tortillas. To finish the soup, you've got to make some slurry. Yep...this will add just a little body to the soup. With the cornstarch in a cup-sized container, mix as little cold water as possible to form a thin paste. This stuff feels and looks like...well, slurry. Bring the soup back up to a boil; stir with 1 hand and pour the slurry in slowly with the other. Continue to cook on high heat for a minute, then reduce to low. The soup will look cloudy at first but will clear up and thicken slightly. Remove from heat. Add cilantro and lime juice. Fill 8 to 12 cups or bowls about 1/4 full of crushed tortilla chips. Ladle soup on top. Place a handful of strips on top of each and serve. This soup (without the tortillas) keeps well for 3 to 4 days refrigerated. Tortillas will also keep well for a few days if sealed well and stored at room temperature. In moist climates they may require re-crisping in a 350 degree F oven for a few minutes. 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken (breast, leg, or thigh) 1/2 cup diced yellow onion 1/2 cup medium-dice green bell peppers 1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves 2 teaspoons oregano leaves 3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons white pepper 4 cups (1 quart) water This "machaca" style cooked meat is very versatile: use in tacos, enchiladas, soup, nachos, burritos, etc. Basically a process of braising, the meat and all ingredients are put together in a large pot and brought slowly to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. If you desire, you can bake all of this in a covered dish in a 350 degree F. oven for about 3 hours for the same results. The meat should be tender to the point where it begins to shred...some of it may require quick chopping. You may want to reserve the liquid for use in soups, etc. Use the cooked meat in your dish right away or refrigerate for up to 3 days. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 
 1/2 fresh bone-in ham (6 to 8 pounds), preferably shank end, with skin 
 Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Roasted sweet potatoes, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 In a small bowl, combine the thyme, parsley and rosemary. Using a sharp knife, score the entire surface of the ham in a crosshatch pattern, cutting down just through the skin to the flesh underneath. Rub the outside of the ham all over with the herb mixture, pressing it gently into the crosshatch spaces between the skin. Sprinkle the ham with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate and come to room temperature, 45 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the herb-crusted ham in a roasting pan. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone, approximately 25 minutes per pound, or 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven to a rack. Tent the ham loosely with aluminum foil and let stand until the center of the ham registers 155 degrees to 160 degrees F on the instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and carve. Serve with roasted sweet potatoes. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 striped bass, 5 to 6 pounds, gills removed, fins trimmed 
 4 egg whites 
 1/2 cup water 
 2 (3 pound) boxes of kosher salt 
 1 handful parsley 
 1 fennel bulb, (with stem) quartered 
 Several sprigs thyme 
 1 lemon, sliced thin 
 1/2 orange, sliced thin 
 Olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Heat oven to 450 degrees. Cover the bottom of a baking sheet large enough to hold the fish with parchment paper. Rinse fish inside and out with cold water and drain. Dry with paper towels. Stuff body cavity with herbs and citrus, saving a few lemon slices for garnish. Set aside. Pour 1 box of salt into a large bowl, add egg whites and water, then the second box of salt. Use your hands to work mixture to a mortar-like consistency. Lay down a 1/2-inch thick bed for the fish to lay on with a 1-inch clearance on all sides. Lay the fish on this bed and pile the remainder of the salt mortar on top. Work into a smooth dome completely encasing the fish. (Don't worry if the head or tail poke out a little.) Cook approximately 35 minutes. Check for doneness by pushing the probe of an instant read thermometer through the salt into the fish. When temperature reaches 130 degrees, remove from oven, and rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Open the fish at the table by hitting the dome several times with a small hammer and lifting off the slabs of salt. Brush away any stray salt. Gently pull out dorsal (back) fin. Using a fish knife or serrated pie server, make a single incision all the way down the back of the fish and around the gill plate. Then lift the skin off working from the head to the tail. Remove meat from top side of fish, going down one side of the spine then the other. Grasp the tail and remove the skeleton, (it should come up intact). The meat revealed below will slide right off the skin. Sprinkle meat with a little virgin oil and lemon juice. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black 
 4 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 1 cup diced yellow onion 
 1/2 cup diced carrots 
 1/2 cup diced celery 
 12 ounces IPA beer 
 1 quart chicken stock 
 1/4 cup brown sugar 
 1/4 cup lime juice 
 2 tablespoons sweet Thai chili sauce 
 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
 1 clove garlic 
 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/3 cup vegetable oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 heads Bibb lettuce 
 3 cups diced tomatoes 
 3 cups black olives, sliced 
 3 cups shredded Cheddar 
 1 1/2 cups guacamole 
 1 1/2 cups sour cream 
 Tortilla chips, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 For the beer-braised chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Season the chicken with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Add the grapeseed oil to the skillet and sear the chicken thighs on all sides until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd the pan or the chicken will steam instead of sear; work in batches if necessary. Transfer the chicken to an oven-safe casserole dish with the onion, carrots and celery. Add the beer to the drippings in the skillet and cook, scraping up the bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and brown sugar and bring to a simmer. Season the braising liquid with salt and pepper. Pour the braising liquid over the chicken and cover the pan with foil. Transfer the casserole dish to the oven and cook until the chicken is tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, remove the foil and allow the chicken to cool in the braising liquid. Shred the chicken meat. For the vinaigrette: In a blender, combine the lime juice, chili sauce, vinegar, mustard, garlic and oregano and puree. Slowly add the olive and vegetable oils while the blender is running. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper. For the salad: Arrange a layer of the lettuce leaves on each plate. Spread 1/4 cup each of the tomatoes, olives, Cheddar and chicken over the lettuce. Drizzle with some vinaigrette and then repeat with an additional layer of lettuce, tomatoes, olives, Cheddar and chicken. Add a final drizzle of vinaigrette and serve with the guacamole, sour cream and tortilla chips on the side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 
 1 teaspoon honey 
 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 4 ripe plums (about 1 pound), pitted and quartered 
 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 cups torn escarole leaves (about 1/2 head) 
 1 bunch watercress, washed, dried, and stems trimmed (about 3 cups) 
 4 ounces aged Gouda cheese, thinly sliced 
 1/4 cup pecan halves, toasted 
 Instructions: 
 For the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, honey, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in oil, starting with a few drops and adding the rest in a steady stream to make a smooth, slightly thick vinaigrette. Set aside. For the salad: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the plums with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Grill the plums until slightly soft, about 1 minute per side. To get distinct grill marks, resist the temptation to move the fruit around on the pan as it cooks. Cut the plum wedges in half crosswise and toss with the dressing. Set the plums aside to marinate in the dressing for 15 minutes. (The salad can be prepared up to this point 1 hour before serving.) Right before serving, toss the greens with the plums and dressing. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates and scatter the cheese and pecans over the tops. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 clove garlic, smashed with a pinch of salt and a little olive oil 
 4 anchovy fillets 
 2 egg yolks 
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
 2 lemons, juiced 
 2 tablespoons water 
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus extra for garnish 
 Freshly ground black pepper

With the blender running, pour the olive oil in slowly for the dressing to emulsify. Stir in the Parmesan, a pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of black pepper; set aside. (Refrigerate the dressing if you will not be using it right away.) Assemble the salad: Tear the lettuce into a large bowl. Add enough dressing to coat the salad to your liking. Add some extra Parmesan and toss the salad well. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 cups old-fashioned oats, such as Quaker 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 pound (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, 1/2-inch-diced 
 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/4 cup lukewarm water 
 Fleur de sel 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the oats, flour, brown sugar, and kosher salt in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse for 45 to 60 seconds, until the oats are coarsely ground. Add the butter and pulse 15 to 20 times, until the butter is the size of peas. Dissolve the baking soda in the lukewarm water and drizzle it over the crumbs in the food processor. Pulse until the mixture is evenly moistened and can be pressed into balls that will hold together. With a medium (1 3/4-inch) ice cream scoop or two spoons, scoop the dough into your hands and roll them into round balls. Evenly space 12 balls on the prepared sheet pans. Flour the bottom of a flat-bottomed 3-inch-diameter drinking glass and use it to flatten each cracker to 1/8 inch thick and about 3 inches in diameter. The crackers will not be perfectly round. If there is a lot of flour on the crackers, turn them over with a metal spatula. Sprinkle with the fleur de sel and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on the edges. Serve warm or at room temperature. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 large artichokes 
 2 lemons 
 2 cups vegetable oil 
 1 bottle dry vermouth 
 8 ounces clam juice 
 20 manila clams, washed and scrubbed 
 2 large shallots, minced 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 4 Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 
 3 tablespoons champagne vinegar 
 8 leaves flat parsley 
 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt 
 4 pearl onions, peeled and sliced 
 12 chives, minced 
 1/2 cup slivered and toasted almonds 
 Instructions: 
 For the artichokes, fill a bowl with water, and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon. Take each artichoke, and remove all outer leaves, and discard. Slice the stem of the artichokes down to 1-inch length, and using a knife, peel away all the outer skin. Rub generously with the remaining lemon. Cut the remaining leaves at the bottom of the base, exposing the hairy choke. With a spoon, scoop out the choke, and discard. Rub the entire surface of the artichoke with lemon, and place in the water. Repeat this process for all the artichokes. Working quickly, slice each artichoke into 4 quarters, and return the pieces to the water. Set aside. Place 2 cups of vegetable oil in a heavy saucepan, and heat over medium heat. To make the vinaigrette, add the vermouth to a saucepan and cook over medium heat until reduced by 3/4 (the alcohol will probably catch on fire, but do not worry). Add the clam juice and continue to reduce until mixture equals 1 cup. Add the clams, cover pot, and steam until barely open. Immediately remove the clams to a small bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Strain the liquid through cheesecloth, rinse pan, and return liquid to pan. Add the shallots, and reduce until mixture has thickened slightly, about 1/4 cup. Add the olive oil, tomatoes, a drop of lemon juice, chopped parsley, and set aside in a warm spot. Remove clams from shells, and season them lightly with salt. Set aside. Drain the artichokes and add them to the oil, and cook gently for 10 minutes. They will bubble vigorously as the moisture evaporates. The artichokes will be done when golden and slightly wrinkled (test one to be sure). Remove from oil, season with salt, and set aside. To serve, place a small pile of artichokes in the center of four plates. Place 5 clams around each pile, and spoon the vinaigrette over them. Sprinkle top with toasted almonds, and garnish with a few drops of lemon juice, sliced pearl onions, and sprinkle with chives. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups unconverted long grain rice 
 8 ounces tomatoes, roughly chopped with the skin on 
 1/2 small onion, finely chopped 
 1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped 
 1/3 cup vegetable oil, chicken fat, or lard 
 3 1/2 cups light chicken broth 
 1/2 medium carrot, cut into 1/4 inch dice 
 1/2 zucchini, cut into 3/8 inch dice 
 1/2 cup chopped poultry hearts and gizzards (optional) 
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl, combine the rice with enough very hot tap water to cover. Stir and let sit for about 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again, shaking thoroughly. In a blender, combine the tomatoes, onion, and garlic and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the container as necessary. Set aside. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice turns a light golden color, about 10 minutes. Do not let it scorch. Add the tomato puree and fry, scraping the bottom of the pan to stop the mixture from sticking, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed. Add the chicken broth, carrots, zucchini, and giblets, if using. Stir in the salt and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook the rice uncovered and undisturbed until almost all of the broth has evaporated and little air holes form in the surface. Cover the top of the pan with a towel and the lid, reduce the heat to very low, and cook for 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes more, so that the rice can absorb the steam and swell. Just before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the juices are redistributed. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
 3 tablespoons sugar 
 1 large egg yolk 
 1 cup all-purpose flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off) 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
 2 tablespoons white rum 
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 1 envelope gelatin 
 1 1/2 pounds cream cheese, softened 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 4 large egg whites 
 2/3 cup sugar 
 1 cup (4 ounces) sliced blanched almonds 
 1 tablespoon beaten egg white 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 Lemon Glaze: 
 1/3 cup water 
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
 2/3 cup apple jelly 
 A drop yellow food coloring 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: 1 (3-inch) 9-inch springform pan; a 10 by 15-inch jelly-roll pan Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom of the springform pan and line with parchment or waxed paper. Set aside. To make the base: Beat together the butter and sugar by hand until light and fluffy. Beat in the yolk until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. With a rubber spatula, gently fold into the butter mixture. The mixture will be crumbly. Transfer the dough into the prepared springform pan and use your hands to pat it down evenly and firmly over the bottom. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and baked through. Transfer to a rack and cool base completely. To make the filling: Combine the rum and lemon juice in a medium, heatproof bowl, and sprinkle the gelatin over the surface. Allow to soak for 5 minutes, then place the bowl over a small pan of gently simmering water and stir several times to melt the gelatin, about 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the pan and cool the gelatin slightly. In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until soft and light, scraping the bowl and beaters often. Beat in the cream until smooth. Combine the egg whites and sugar in the clean, dry bowl of the electric mixer and heat over simmering water, whisking constantly, until the egg whites are hot and sugar is dissolved. Attach the bowl to the mixer and whip with the whisk attachment at medium speed until cold and firm. Beat 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture into the dissolved gelatin, then beat the gelatin mixture into the remaining cream cheese. Fold in the meringue in several additions. Pour the filling into the prepared pan and refrigerate until at least 6 hours or overnight. To prepare the almonds: Position the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Put the almonds in a jellyroll pan, pour the egg whites over them, and rub the almonds between the palms of your hands to coat evenly. Stir in the sugar. Bake for about 20 minutes, stirring often, until the almonds are well toasted and sugar has caramelized slightly. Cool, and store in a tin or jar at room temperature until ready to use. To make the glaze: Combine the water and lemon juice in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the surface. Allow to soak for 5 minutes. Bring the jelly to a boil and add the gelatin mixture. Return to a boil, and remove from heat. Add the food coloring and pour over the chilled cheesecake. Chill again to set the glaze. To unmold the cheesecake, run a knife or thin spatula around the inside of the pan pressing the knife against the pan, not the cake. Unbuckle the pan side and lift off. Leave the cake on the base, or run a spatula under the cake base and slide the cake onto a platter. Press the sugared almonds around the sides. Keep refrigerated until time to serve. To serve, cut the cake into wedges with a knife warmed in hot water and wiped dry, refrigerate leftovers. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 chicken halves, breast and rib bones intact (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds each) 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 5 to 6 sprigs thyme 
 Instructions: 
 Partially debone the chicken halves, removing the wing, backbone and thighbone. Rinse and pat dry. Refrigerate, uncovered, at least 30 minutes to dry out the skin. Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a large nonstick skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat and add the oil and butter. Lay the chicken halves, skin-side down, in the skillet and scatter the thyme around them. Wrap a slightly smaller skillet with foil and place on top of the chicken. Set a large brick or 2 to 3 heavy cans in the skillet to weigh it down. Cook the chicken 3 to 5 minutes, then remove the top skillet and check the skin; adjust the heat and rotate the pan as needed so the skin browns evenly. Replace the top skillet and continue to cook until the skin is golden and crisp and the chicken is cooked about three-quarters of the way through, 20 to 25 more minutes. Remove the top skillet and carefully flip the chicken. Cook, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Cut each piece in half to serve. Photograph by Tina Rupp <|endoftext|>

 2 large avocados, peeled, pitted, and sliced 
 2 poblano chiles, roasted, peeled, seeded, and julienned 
 1 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese 
 Fresh chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish 
 1 pound tomatillos, husked 
 4 jalapenos, roasted 
 1 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves chopped 
 4 cloves garlic 
 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 
 1 lime, juiced 
 Salt 
 1 cup olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss chicken with all of the seasonings. Cover with plastic wrap, and allow chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a grill or a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill chicken on each side for 1 to 2 minutes per side. If your pan is not oven-safe, then transfer chicken to a baking dish and let finish cooking in the oven for 7 to 9 minutes, or until fully cooked through. Let the chicken cool, slice it into julienne strips, and reserve. Heat a pan of canola oil until the temperature of the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Fry the tortilla strips until crisp, about 2 minutes. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the strips from the pan and let drain on a paper towel. In a large mixing bowl, toss the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes with 1 cup of the Tomatillo Vinaigrette. Toss until all ingredients are well mixed. Divide the lettuce mixture evenly among 4 dinner plates or individual salad bowls. Arrange 4 tomato quarters around the edge of each salad. In a circular pattern, arrange the chicken atop each salad, alternated with the avocado and poblano slices in between. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup cheese over each salad. Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over the chicken and vegetables. Garnish with the tortilla strips and cilantro. Add the tomatillos to a pot of simmering water, and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain the tomatillos into a colander, and allow them to cool slightly. In blender, combine all of the ingredients except the oil. Puree the mixture for 15 seconds, and then continue blending for 30 seconds, slowly drizzling in the olive oil through the top until the dressing emulsifies. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup fresh basil leaves 
 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves 
 1/4 cup pine nuts 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 2 (3 pound) pork loins, 10 to 12-inches long 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 
 2 cups fresh spinach 
 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 Instructions: 
 For the pesto: In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, pulse the basil and mint 3 to 4 times or until chopped, then add the pine nuts and salt and pulse an additional 2 to 3 times. Add the garlic and cheese, pulse 2 times. With the food processor running, slowly add the oil to blend, this should take 1 minute. Don't over-pulse or puree; this will result in a brown liquid sauce, not a bright herb pesto. For the pork: To butterfly the pork, place each loin on a cutting board and slice lengthwise through the center, about 3 inches deep, but not cutting all the way through, until it opens to form a 10 by 10-inch square. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season the inside of both loins with salt and pepper and evenly spread the pesto, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle with feta and top with spinach. Roll tightly lengthwise. With butchers twine, tie several knots around the stuffed loins, 4 to 5 times, to ensure even cooking. Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed saute pan over high heat, season the outside of the loins with salt and pepper, and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and place the loins on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds California red seedless grapes 
 2 lemons, juiced 
 1 1/2 cups sugar 
 1 cup water 
 2 sachets powdered gelatin (approximately 2 tablespoons) 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup water 
 2 slices lemon, seeds removed 
 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, finely sliced into coins 
 1 handful fresh basil leaves 
 2 cups California red seedless grapes 
 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup julienne crystallized ginger, plus more for garnish 
 Small basil buds, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 To make the gelee: Put the grapes, lemon juice, sugar and water in a medium-sized pot and set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 minutes until grapes are tender and skins have completely discolored. Using a potato masher squash the grapes to release all of the juices. Do not puree in a blender otherwise your gelee will be cloudy and pick up parts of the skin. Pour the mixture through a sieve over a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout and use the back of a ladle to firmly press the pulp - this will extract as much juice and flavor as possible. This should yield about 3 cups (24 ounces) of liquid. If it is more or less add water or pour out some of the liquid, otherwise the gelatine ratio will be off. Slowly whisk in the gelatin powder, making sure you continue to whisk until it is all fully incorporated. Divide the grape jelly mixture into 4 to 6 glasses depending on the size of your glasses. Gently agitate to remove any surface bubbles then refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, or overnight, until set. To make the salad: In a small pot, over medium heat, add the sugar, cold water, sliced lemon and ginger. Bring to a simmer, then add in the basil and shut off the heat to allow the mixture to steep, 20 minutes. Cut the grapes in half through the middle and add to a large mixing bowl. Dress the grapes with a little of the syrup and toss to combine. Discard the basil and reserve the extra syrup. To make the whipped cream: Using a balloon whisk, whip the cream, sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Fold the ginger into the whipped cream but reserve a few pieces for garnish. To assemble the dish: When the gelee is set, remove it from the refrigerator and top each glass with a spoonful of the grape salad and a quenelle of the ginger whipped cream. Garnish with basil buds and some slivers of ginger. Drizzle each glass with some of the reserved lemon-ginger syrup and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (6 pound) boneless leg of lamb, with shank 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 
 3 tablespoons pureed garlic 
 2 tablespoons chopped chipotles (canned) 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Pimento Sauce (recipe follows) 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 5 shallots, finely sliced 
 1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced 
 3/4 cup dry white wine 
 5 cups lamb stock or beef broth 
 1 teaspoon tomato paste 
 3 tablespoons pimento or roasted red pepper pureed in a blender 
 1 teaspoon pureed garlic 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cold 
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Ask a butcher to remove all bones, except shank, and to clean meat of all sinew and excess fat inside and out. Butterfly leg for stuffing. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lay lamb flat on counter. Using a sharp knife, make several slits, about 2 inches long by 1/4 inch deep, so seasonings can penetrate meat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Puree whole garlic cloves with a little olive oil in a food processor. Add canned chipotles and blend into a paste. Spread the paste on the lamb and cover with the oregano. Roll meat to enclose stuffing and tie with string at 1inch intervals, keeping the diameter of the roll the same so that the roast cooks evenly. Shank bone will protrude at one end. Generously season outside with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Brown lamb on all sides. Roast on rack in roasting pan 30 to 40 minutes for medium rare, 1 hour for well done. (A meat thermometer inserted to the center should read 160 to 165 degrees or a thin blade knife inserted to the center for 20 seconds should feel lukewarm on your lips.) Let sit at room temperature about 10 minutes before carving, so juices can run to center. Remove strings and slice meat thinly across the roll. Top with Pimento Sauce. By removing the center bone, leg of lamb is much easier to carve and serve to guests. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Cook shallots and mushrooms until golden. Add wine, turn heat to high, and reduce by half. Add stock and reduce again by a quarter. Whisk in tomato paste, pimento puree and garlic. Break butter into small pieces and whisk into sauce until smooth. Adjust seasonings and strain through a fine sieve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 pound very cold unsalted butter, diced 
 3 pounds Bosc pears 
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 
 2 tablespoons dried cranberries 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
 1/4 pound cold unsalted butter (1 stick), diced 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the pastry, place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and toss quickly with your fingers to coat each cube of butter with the flour. Pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the 1/4 cup ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and form into 2 disks. Wrap the disks with plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Roll each pastry disk into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer them to 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. For the filling, peel, core, and quarter the pears. Cut each quarter into big chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. Divide the pear chunks between the pastries, covering the dough and leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cranberries over the top of each tart. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Pour into a bowl and rub it with your fingers until it starts holding together. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the two tarts. Gently fold the border of each tart over the pears, pleating it to make a circle. Bake the crostatas for 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the pears are tender. Let the tarts cool for 5 minutes, then use 2 large spatulas to transfer them to wire racks. <|endoftext|>

Concurrently, in a mixing bowl, whisk eggs and sugar together. When the milk reaches a simmer, whisk in 1 cup of the hot milk to the egg mixture. Whisk this mix back to the hot milk, reduce heat to low and constantly stir with a wooden spoon. When mixture thickens enough to coat the back the wooden spoon and a line drawn with your finger holds it shape (about 12 to 15 minutes), immediately strain through a chinoise (fine sieve) into another bowl (a little smaller than the ice bath bowl) and place in ice bath. Stir occasionally to cool down. If there are any vanilla beans left on the pods, scrape into the anglaise. Stir to incorporate and chill sauce until ready to use.Sift the flour, salt and sugar into a food processor fitted with a blade. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles coarse meal, there should be pieces of butter. Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing the processor. Only add enough water until the dough just holds together (about 3 to 4 tablespoons). Wrap in plastic and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Vanilla Ice Cream: Freeze according to machine?s instructions. Bittersweet Chocolate Tart: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to about 9-inch diameter. Use an 8-inch false bottom tart pan and carefully place dough into the pan. Work the dough into the corners and prick with a fork. Cover with foil and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Fill pan with pie weights, rice or beans and bake blind for 15 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough becomes very light tan. Pull pan out of the oven and let cool at room temperature. For the filling, bring the cream to a simmer. Pull off of the heat and add the chocolate. When chocolate is completely melted, mix well, and let cool in the refrigerator. When chocolate mixture is cold, pull out of the refrigerator and whisk in the eggs just until incorporated. Pour into the tart shell and bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes. It should still tremble in the center when lightly shaken. Let tart cool on a rack before demolding. Garnish with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. On a large plate, garnish the rim of the plate with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Ladle a small pool of creme anglaise. Place a slice of the tart off of the side and place 1 scoop of ice cream next to it. For the ultimate, make individual tarts. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 large ripe mango, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped 
 1 small roasted red pepper, peeled, seeded and chopped 
 Juice of 2 fresh limes 
 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped red onion 
 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 
 1 to 2 teaspoon chipotle pepper puree (depending on how spicy you like) 
 1/2 cup canola oil 
 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves 
 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 
 Honey, to taste 
 Salt and freshly ground pepper 
 Peanut oil 
 1 1/2 cups rice flour 
 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups cold water 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3/4 pound baby squid, cut into rings 
 1 1/2 pounds stone crab claws, meat removed and chopped 
 1/2 pound micro greens 
 1/4 pound watercress 
 1 head frisee 
 4 whole cherry peppers, jarred in vinegar, drained and thinly sliced 
 Cilantro leaves, for garnish 
 Chopped fresh mint, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 For the vinaigrette: Place all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth; season with honey, salt and pepper to taste. For the crab and squid salad: Fill a large saucepan halfway with the oil and heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper towels, set aside. Whisk together the flour and 1 1/2 cups of the water in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. The mixture should resemble crepe batter; if it is too thick add more water a few tablespoons at a time. Then season with salt and pepper. Season squid and crab with salt and pepper and working in batches, dip 1/3 of the squid in the rice flour batter and allow the excess to drip off. Fry until lightly golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towel-lined plate and season immediately with salt. Repeat with the remaining squid and crab, dipping into the batter then frying in batches. Place the greens in a bowl and drizzle with about 1/4 cup of the mango-red pepper vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. Mound the greens on a platter and place some of the sliced cherry peppers on top. Place the squid and crab around the perimeter of the platter, drizzle all with more of the vinaigrette and garnish with cilantro leaves and chopped mint. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 14.75-ounce can cream-style corn 
 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 
 1/2 cup sour cream 
 2/3 cup sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 5 large egg yolks 
 Caramel corn or bourbon, for topping (optional) 
 Instructions: 
 Make the custard: Whisk the corn, half-and-half, sour cream, sugar and vanilla in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Lightly beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk about 1/4 cup of the warm corn mixture into the beaten egg yolks, then pour into the saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon, about 5 minutes. Transfer the hot custard to a blender and pulse until smooth (keep the filler cap slightly open to let steam escape). Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.) Freeze the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, 2 to 3 hours. Scoop the ice cream into bowls. Top with caramel corn or a splash of bourbon, if desired.

 Ricotta mixture 
 Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 Fresh basil leaves 
 Bolognese Sauce 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the Bolognese Sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the shanks on both sides with salt and pepper, place in the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the shanks to a plate. Remove fat from the pan. Add the pancetta to the pan and cook until golden brown. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan and cook until soft and lightly golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the red wine, scrape the bottom of the pan and cook until completely reduced. Add the beef stock, diced tomatoes, thyme, rosemary and parsley and bring to a simmer. Add the shanks and 1/3 of the pancetta back to the pan, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove the shanks to a cutting board and when cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-size pieces and place in a bowl. Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl. Place 3 cups of the cooking liquid into a large high-sided saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to about 3/4 cup. Add the shredded meat and the remaining cooked pancetta to the pan along with 1 cup of the tomato sauce, parsley and basil and stir to combine and just heat through. For the Ricotta Mixture: Stir together the ricotta, eggs, parsley, basil, cheese and salt and pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld. For the Tomato Sauce: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red chili flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, bring to boil, season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce is reduced and thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and basil. For the Bechamel (Mornay) Sace: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and let cook for about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in 2 cups of the hot milk and continue whisking until the sauce is thickened and loses its raw flavor, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season the sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper and whisk in the cheeses. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in some of the remaining milk. For Assembly: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter. Ladle a thin layer of bechamel evenly over the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of pasta dough, cut to fit the inside of the pan on top of the bechamel and top the pasta with the ricotta mixture and spread evenly. Spread a thin layer of bechamel over the ricotta, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Top with another layer of pasta and spread the meat mixture evenly over the top. Ladle an even layer of bechamel over the Bolognese mixture, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Place the final layer of pasta dough over the meat mixture and ladle the bechamel over the top to completely cover the pasta and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of Parmesan. Place the pan on a baking sheet and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 to 35 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting. Cut into slices and top with some of the tomato sauce, more grated cheese and chopped parsley and basil. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound haricots verts (thin French beans), trimmed 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
 2 teaspoons white-wine vinegar

 Instructions: 
 Steam beans until just tender, 3 to 8 minutes. While beans are steaming, whisk together remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Toss beans with dressing and season with salt and pepper.; <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 -ounce packet unflavored gelatin (2 1/2 teaspoons) 
 4 cups whole milk 
 2 vanilla beans 
 12 large egg yolks 
 1 cup sugar 
 6 tablespoons cornstarch 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 
 1 tablespoon powdered espresso 
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 6 large eggs 
 3 cups sugar 
 3 tablespoons light corn syrup 
 Instructions: 
 For the Cream Filling: Prepare the cream fillings: Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl and set aside to bloom. Place the milk in a pan. Halve the vanilla beans lengthwise; scrape out the seeds with a paring knife, then add the seeds and pods to the milk. Bring to a simmer, then cover and remove from the heat. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Remove the vanilla pods from the milk. Gradually whisk one-third of the warm milk into the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the remaining milk in the pan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 6 minutes. Continue boiling until the mixture is custard-like, 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Slice the butter into pieces and whisk into the custard, then stir in the gelatin mixture. Microwave the chocolate until melted, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Mix 2 tablespoons hot water with the espresso. Transfer half of the cream filling to a bowl, then stir in the chocolate and espresso. Transfer the remaining cream filling to another bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the chocolate and vanilla creams and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours. When ready to fill the puffs, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks with a mixer. Fold half into the vanilla cream filling and half into the chocolate filling. Transfer each filling to a large pastry bag with a 1/4-inch tip and set aside. (To do this cleanly, cuff the open end of the pastry bag over your hand.) For the Pastry Puffs: Unfilled puffs can be frozen for up to a week. To re-crisp, thaw, then brush with a beaten egg; bake 5 minutes at 350 degrees. While the fillings chill, make the pastry puffs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bring 1 1/2 cups water, the butter, sugar and salt to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to melt the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Return to the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste is shiny and pulls away from the pan, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer the paste to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed to cool, 1 minute. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the dough to a large pastry bag with a 1/2-inch tip. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, dabbing a bit of dough under the corners to keep the paper in place. Pipe 1 1/2-inch balls of dough onto the paper (about 48 total). Smooth the dough peaks with a wet finger. Bake until puffed, 15 to 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake until golden, 15 minutes. Turn off the oven; keep the puffs inside 10 minutes to dry out. Pierce each puff with a dry piping tip; transfer to a rack to cool. To Assemble: Fill half of the puffs with chocolate cream and half with vanilla: Insert the tip of the pastry bag into the hole and squeeze until full. Chill the filled puffs 30 minutes before assembling the tower. Make the caramel: Mix the sugar, corn syrup and 1 cup water in a saucepan, cover and bring to a boil over high heat; don't stir. Uncover and boil, swirling the pan, until the syrup turns deep amber, 20 minutes. Immediately dip the bottom of the saucepan in a large bowl of ice water for a few seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the caramel to a liquid measuring cup and cool slightly (it should still be liquid). Be careful-the caramel will still be hot! Draw a 7-inch circle on parchment paper. Partially dip each filled puff into the caramel and let the excess drip off. Arrange the puffs around the circle. If the caramel hardens, microwave until soft, 45 seconds. Fill the base circle with more puffs for stability, then continue building a conical tower of smaller circles. Top the tower with a single puff. Line your work surface with parchment paper-the next step can be messy. Dip the tip of a fork into the caramel and quickly wave it in circles around the tower to create a web of caramel strands. Repeat. Let set, then slide two spatulas under the paper and transfer the croquembouche to a platter. Tear off the excess paper around the base. To serve, crack the caramel web with the back of a knife, then dismantle the tower and transfer the cream puffs to plates. Photographs by Karl Juengel <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups flour 
 4 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 2 tablespoons shortening 
 1 cup buttermilk, chilled 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using your fingertips, rub butter and shortening into dry ingredients until mixture looks like crumbs. (The faster the better, you don't want the fats to melt.) Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir just until the dough comes together. The dough will be very sticky. Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. Press into a 1-inch thick round. Cut out biscuits with a 2-inch cutter, being sure to push straight down through the dough. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible and continue cutting. (Biscuits from the second pass will not be quite as light as those from the first, but hey, that's life.) Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Olive oil, for frying (about 4 cups) 
 Vegetable oil, for frying (about 4 cups) 
 3 large russet or Yukon gold potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds) 
 2 cloves garlic 
 1 sprig rosemary 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Fill a large pot with about 1 1/2 inches of equal parts olive oil and vegetable oil. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Slice the potatoes on the thinnest setting of a mandoline (they should be almost see-through). Lay the slices on a clean kitchen towel in a single layer and pat dry with paper towels. One at a time, transfer the slices to the cold oil (starting with cold oil keeps the potatoes from sticking to one another). If the potatoes are not completely submerged, add more oil to cover. Add the garlic and rosemary to the pot. Turn the heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Stir the potatoes once to make sure they are not sticking to the bottom, then let fry, undisturbed, until golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the chips with a strainer and drain on paper towels. Season with salt. Photograph by David Malosh <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 4-inch long zucchini (about 1 1/2 pounds) 
 1 large potato 
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
 Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
 Salt and pepper 
 4 teaspoons homemade or prepared pesto 
 Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling

 Tortilla chips 
 Instructions: 
 For the sauce: Place the ketchup, brown sugar, syrup, vinegar, Worcestershire, pepper and garlic in a small pot. Bring to a low boil, reduce the heat to low and thicken 15 minutes. (This sauce stores well for weeks and makes a tasty sloppy Joe, burger baster and pork chop topper if you want to double the recipe. If using for a more all-purpose BBQ sauce, add 1/2 cup chicken stock and simmer for 20 minutes.) For the chowder: Heat the EVOO in a soup pot over medium-high heat and add the bacon, if using. Cook until crisp 2 to 3 minutes. Add the potatoes, corn, celery, onions, bell pepper, chile, garlic, thyme, seafood seasoning and bay leaf, and stir. Cook to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the beer and cook the beer down by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes, shredded chicken, BBQ Sauce, stock and 2 cups of water. Simmer a few minutes to combine the flavors, cool and store for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat. When ready to serve, peel, pit and dice the avocado and dress it in the lime juice. Place diced avocado and some broken tortilla chips in each soup bowl, top with the hot chowder and serve. <|endoftext|>

Line a half sheet tray with a nonstick silicon mat or spray with nonstick spray. Spread the squares out evenly on the half sheet tray, and lightly brush with the cream. Bake in the oven until golden and puffy, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the puffs to a wire rack to cool. For the orange sabayon: Combine the sugar and egg yolks in a large metal mixing bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (to create a double-boiler) and whisk until the yolks become pale yellow in color. Continue to whisk over low to medium heat until the mixture begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add the juices and zests and continue to whisk so the sauce thickens back up again. Add the liqueur and whisk until incorporated and the sabayon is light, fluffy and has good volume, 2 minutes longer. Assemble the raspberries and puff pastry together on a plate (if serving individual plates, allow 2 puffs per plate). Drizzle with the honey and pour the sabayon over and around the raspberries and puff pastry squares. Dust with the confectioners' sugar. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 6 thick-cut (1/4-inch) slices bacon 
 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling 
 8 cherry tomatoes, halved 
 2 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced 
 1 small clove garlic, minced 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 head iceberg lettuce 
 1 teaspoon paprika (preferably smoked) 
 3 Perfect Soft-Boiled "6 Minute" Eggs, recipe follows 
 1 avocado, halved, pitted, peeled and cut lengthwise into 12 wedges 
 2 small red radishes, very thinly sliced 
 1 small red onion, thinly sliced and separated into rings (about 12 rings) 
 1 to 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, or to taste 
 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, such as basil, parsley and chives, for garnish, optional 
 6 large eggs, at room temperature 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Cook the bacon slices in a medium skillet until crisp. Drain on paper towels and halve the slices crosswise; set aside. Preheat a gas grill or stovetop griddle to medium-high heat. In a small bowl, toss together 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the tomatoes, basil and garlic; season with salt and pepper, toss to combine and set aside. Stand the iceberg head upright on the core. With a sharp knife, cut a 1-inch-thick slice out of the center (thickest part) of the lettuce head, creating a thick, round disc. Lay the lettuce disc on a work surface and cut away the core. Slicing horizontally, cut the disc in half again, creating two 1/2-inch-thick round lettuce "steaks." In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the paprika, and season with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of the lettuce steaks with the oil mixture and grill just to give the lettuce a little color, about 30 seconds on each side. To assemble the salad, put the grilled iceberg discs on 2 serving plates. Slice the top and bottom of each egg so it will stand upright, and halve each crosswise; set 3 egg halves upright on each lettuce disc. Arrange 6 wedges of avocado and 6 pieces of bacon on each disc, pointing inward and stacking them on top of each other. Scatter the radish slices and onion rings evenly over each salad and divide the tomatoes between each, scattering them over the top. Drizzle a little olive oil and the red wine vinegar over each salad and onto the plate. Sprinkle the blue cheese over the top of the salads and onto the plate and garnish each with a sprinkling of chopped herbs. Serve immediately. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the eggs into the water and cook for exactly 6 minutes. (Note: It is imperative that the eggs are at room temperature before cooking them to achieve the right consistency with this method.) Meanwhile, fill a bowl with ice water. Using a strainer or slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the boiling water and lower them into the ice water. Let stand for at least 5 minutes; peel. When sliced, the eggs should have firm whites with runny yolks that are just beginning to set. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups rinsed cannelini beans, picked over and rinsed 
 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
 1/2 onion, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1/4-inch dice 
 3 large cloves garlic, peeled, split, germ removed, and finely chopped 
 Salt and freshly ground white pepper 
 1 tablespoon tomato paste 
 2 tomatoes, 1 peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice, the other just cut in half 
 7 cups unsalted Vegetable Stock (page 348) or store-bought low-sodium vegetable broth 
 6 stalks celery, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 3-inch lengths 
 3 medium carrots, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 3-inch lengths 
 2 large turnips, peeled, trimmed, and quartered 
 1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and quartered 
 Bouquet garni (3 sprigs Italian parsley, 2 sprigs sage, and 2 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine) 
 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 
 2 large cloves garlic, peeled, split, germ removed, and very finely chopped 
 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley leaves 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 Instructions: 
 The night before you want to make the cassoulet, put the dried beans in a pot with enough cold water to cover them by at least an inch. Let the beans soak overnight in the refrigerator, then rinse and drain them. (Or, if you're in a rush--or you haven't planned far enough in advance--bring the water with the beans to a boil, boil for 2 minutes, pull the pot from the heat, and soak the beans for an hour. Rinse the beans under cold water and drain.) Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small saute pan or skillet over medium heat. When it's hot, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are tender but not colored, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and, when it's incorporated evenly, add the diced tomato; pull the pan from the heat and set aside. Put the beans in a Dutch oven or large casserole. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Add the celery, carrots, turnips, fennel, split tomato, and the bouquet garni. Cut a parchment paper circle to fit inside the pot (see Glossary, page 369) and press the paper gently against the ingredients. Lower the heat so that the liquid bubbles at a steady simmer, and cook, stirring now and then, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. Season the casserole with salt and pepper shortly before the beans are cooked through. When the beans are done, pull the pot from the heat and remove and discard the bouquet garni and whatever is left of the tomato. Drain the liquid from the pot into a pitcher and keep close at hand. Working gently, transfer the vegetables to a bowl. Spoon the beans into a baking dish--a pottery casserole would be perfect--and stir in the onion-tomato paste mixture along with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add enough of the reserved cooking liquid to just cover the beans. Top with the vegetables and moisten with more of the cooking liquid. Reserve the remaining liquid if you are going to reheat the cassoulet. (The cassoulet can be made up to this point a day in advance, cooled, and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator. Bring it to room temperature, then reheat it for about 1 hour in a 350 degree F. oven, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if the casserole seems dry. Fifteen minutes before the cassoulet's ready, put on the crust and turn up the oven temperature, as directed below.) The Crust: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss together the bread crumbs, garlic, and parsley and stir in the melted butter. Spread the mixture evenly over the cassoulet and slide the casserole into the oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crumbs are golden brown and crusty. To Serve: Bring the casserole to the table and serve immediately, spooning crust, vegetables, and beans into warm soup plates. <|endoftext|>

Cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 18 tablespoons (2 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 3 cups sugar 
 6 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 
 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/3 cup cornstarch 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature 
 3/4 pound confectioners' sugar, sifted 
 1 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin pans with paper liners. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed, until light and fluffy. On medium speed, add the eggs, 2 at a time, then add the sour cream and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and stir until smooth. Sift together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until just combined. Fill the cupcake liners to the top with batter. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool to room temperature. For the icing, mix the butter, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, on low speed, mixing just until smooth. Spread the frosting generously on top of each cupcake. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butte 
 2 cups granulated sugar 
 3/4 cup brown sugar 
 3/4 cup water 
 2 tablespoons molasses 
 2 tablespoons instant coffee powder 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 pound bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted 
 Toasted nuts, optional 
 Sea salt, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Prepare a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or greased parchment or wax paper. In a large sized heavy-bottomed sauce pan, with a candy thermometer attached, bring all the ingredients, excluding the chocolate, to a boil over medium low heat. Continue to cook and stir the mixture until it reads 275 degrees F on the candy thermometer. The mixture will be much thicker. Stir constantly until it reaches 315 degrees F, which will happen pretty quickly. Remove it from the heat and stir until very smooth, just a few seconds. Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet. Using a spatula, spread the toffee out, working quickly because the toffee will set fast. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, VERY GENTLY (you don't want to cut so deep that it actually reaches the bottom or you may destroy your silpat) score the toffee into bite sized pieces. You should get about 72 pieces. Again work quickly so the toffee doesn't set before you are done. Allow the toffee to sit until it is room temperature and then break apart the pieces. Melt the chocolate over a double boiler until perfectly smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to just above room temperature. If the chocolate is too hot it will run off the toffee and not give you a nice coating, if it is too cold it will be too thick to work with. Set up a second baking sheet with a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Drop a piece of the toffee into the chocolate. Use a fork to flip the toffee over to coat the other side. Lift the covered toffee from the chocolate and shake gently to allow the excess to fall away. In order to get a nice smooth bottom, you want to scrape the bottom of the fork on the edge of the bowl, before laying it on the parchment to harden. If you want to sprinkle with toasted nuts and sea salt, this is the time. Continue dipping until they are all covered in chocolate. Allow them to sit out in a cool spot to set up or you can set them in the refrigerator for a few minutes until they are firm. Fill decorative bags as gifts for Valentine's Day. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 recipe Achiote Citrus Marinade (recipe follows) 
 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs and thighs 
 24 small corn tortillas (recipe follows), or use store-bought 
 1 recipe Salsa Fresca (recipe follows) 
 2 avocados, peeled and sliced 
 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped 
 2/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 
 1/4 cup achiote paste 
 2 to 3 jalapeno chiles stemmed and seeded if desired 
 7 garlic cloves, peeled 
 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 1 bunch cilantro, stems and leaves 
 4 cups finely ground deep yellow masa harina 
 2 3/4 cups cold water 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 4 medium ripe tomatoes, cored, seeded, and finely diced 
 1/4 red onion, minced 
 2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded and minced 
 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only chopped 
 2 tablespoons lime juice 
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
 Pinch of freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Rub the marinade all over the chicken pieces. Place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 350/. Lift the chicken pieces from the marinade and transfer to a roasting pan. Roast for about 40 minutes, or until the meat easily pulls away from the bone. Set the chicken aside to cool and pour the cooking juices from the pan into a bowl or cup. Refrigerate the juices so that the fat rises to the top. When the chicken is cool, remove and discard the skin, if desired, and bones and cut or shred the meat into bitesized pieces. Refrigerate the chicken if you do not plan to use it right away. When you are ready to make the tacos, skim off and discard the fat which has risen from the cooking juices, and use the brown cooking liquid which remains to reheat the chicken in a low oven. Dip a corn tortilla in some water and shake off the excess. Toast one at a time in a nonstick pan over medium heat for about 1 minute on each side. Wrap in a towel to keep warm while you dip and heat the remaining tortillas. For each taco, stack 2 tortillas. Divide the warm chicken and place on top. Top with Salsa Fresca, sliced avocado, and chopped cilantro. Combine 1/3 cup of the orange juice, the achiote paste, jalapenos, garlic, peppercorns and salt in a blender or food processor. Puree until the peppercorns are completely crushed. Add the cilantro and the remaining 1/3 cup orange juice and puree until smooth. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small piece of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 12 large balls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Line a tortilla press with 2 sheets of plastic cut from a plastic freezer bag or other heavy duty plastic bag. Heat a dry cast iron skillet, or non-stick pan until moderately hot. Flatten each ball of dough in the tortilla press, then remove the plastic from the top and, holding the tortilla with your fingertips, peel off the bottom sheet. Lay the tortillas one by one on the skillet and cook about 30 to 45 seconds per side, pressing the top of each tortilla with your fingertips to make it puff. Place the hot tortillas on a towel. When they are still warm but not hot, stack and wrap in a towel. Serve immediately or let cool, wrap well in plastic or a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator up to a week. In a mixing bowl combine all the ingredients. Stir and toss well. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator no more than 1 day. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 2 medium onions, diced 
 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 
 Pinch salt 
 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
 3 tablespoons ketchup 
 1 tablespoon yellow mustard 
 1 tablespoon hot sauce 
 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
 1/2 teaspoon paprika 
 Instructions: 
 Caramelized Onions: Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and lightly caramelized about 15 minutes. Add the mustard and a pinch of salt and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan to a small bowl and set aside. Special Sauce: In a medium bowl combine all the ingredients and whisk until smooth. Burgers: Preheat the broiler to low. Form the ground meat mixture into 6 equal patties. Do not over handle or compress the patties, keep them loose. This will help create a tender burger. Over mixing and compacting will result in a tough heavy burger. Heat the canola oil a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. In a small bowl combine the salt, pepper and garlic powder and season the burgers generously with the mixture. Put the patties in the skillet and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and let cook for 1 minute, then top each patty with a piece of cheese. Cook for another 2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the burgers are medium. While the burgers are cooking, lightly brush the buns with melted butter and put them on a sheet pan. Broil until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. To assemble, split the buns and spread each half with about a tablespoon of the special sauce. Put the burgers on the bottom half of each bun, top with caramelized onions, tomato and lettuce. Cover with the top half of the bun and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/4 teaspoon coarse black pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 
 1 duck, butchered into leg and breast 
 1 pint lard or grapeseed oil 
 9 heads Belgian endive 
 1/3 cup olive oil 
 3 teaspoons sugar 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 ripe mangoes, peeled and sliced away from the seed 
 1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced 
 1/2 pint large raspberries, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 The duck has to be prepared the day before because of the long slow cooking time. If you are purchasing a pre-cooked confit of duck, skip the instructions in this paragraph and follow the directions on the package of the product. In any event, you will need to shred the duck for use in this recipe. For your own confit of duck, mix the salt, pepper and garlic together and coat the duck with the seasonings rubbing into the surface of the duck. On the stovetop, heat the oil or lard in a deep roasting pan (if you will be using the oven) or in a large Dutch oven (if you will be cooking on the range). (Note: you will be poaching the duck, not frying it, so, it is important to avoid making the oil too hot.) Add the duck to the warm oil. If you are using the oven, put the duck in a preheated 200 degree F oven for about 6 to 8 hours. If you are using the stovetop, cook the duck at a simmer. In either case, the duck must be cooked until it falls away from the bone. Remove all the duck meat from the bones and reserve meat until needed. Cut the endive in half and remove the core. Lightly sear the cut sides of the endive in olive oil over medium heat in a nonstick pan. Sprinkle in the sugar, salt, pepper, and butter - cover and continue to cook until al dente - about 10 minutes. You want the endive to be slightly tender, but firm enough to support the duck filling. Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat, and let cool. Prepare the mango/berry puree by adding the mango and strawberries to a blender or food processor and blending until smooth. If duck is cold, heat or re-heat it, depending on whether you have made your own confit, or have purchased it prepared. Shred the duck with 2 forks. Fill each endive-half with duck, spoon mango berry puree on top and garnish with a raspberry. Serve slightly warm. <|endoftext|>

 2 tablespoons sugar 
 2 large nectarines, sliced into 1/3 inch wedges 
 1/4 cup shlivovitz or brandy 
 1/2 pound fresh bing cherries, pitted* (optional) 
 Instructions: 
 For the crepes: Put all of the ingredients except the butter into a food processor or blender and process until smooth, about 10 seconds. If necessary, scrape down any solids that stick to the sides. Add the butter and process for a few more seconds to blend. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight. Set a 10-inch, non-stick crepe pan over moderately high heat, then spray with non-stick vegetable spray. When nice and hot, remove the pan from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of batter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until lightly browned. Set aside on a plate, cooked side up, and continue with the remainder of the batter. For the filling: In a small saucepan, cover the cherries with water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let rest. In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, sugar, and egg until blended. Gently mix in the pot, farmer, or cottage cheese. Drain the cherries and mix them in. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in the lower center of the blintz. Fold up once from the bottom, and then fold over the sides. Roll up the rest of the way. Repeat with the rest. Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan. In small batches (4), fry the blintzes fold side down until golden brown. Gently flip to fry the other side. Serve with sour cream, and Nectarines and Cherries, Flambeed in Shlivoviz. In a bowl, whisk together the cherry juice and cornstarch. In a hot saute pan, melt the butter. Add the sugar, then the nectarines. Carefully pour in the shlivovitz. If it does not burst into flames spontaneously, ignite with a match. Gently swirl the pan and baste the nectarines until the flames die out. Add the cherry juice mixture and cook until bubbling for 10 seconds. Take the sauce off the heat; add the thawed and fresh cherries. <|endoftext|>

 Chopped fresh basil leaves 
 Pinch salt 
 10 to 25 jalapeno peppers (larger then average size will make them easier to stuff) 
 1/2 to 1 pound thinly sliced bacon (Pork Fat Rulez!) 
 Toothpicks (for the peppers, not your teeth silly) 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the grill. Mix each package of cream cheese with chopped garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and a dash of chopped basil. Add a pinch of salt. Mix until mixture is soft and manageable. Slice each jalapeno lengthwise on 1 side, being careful not to cut the jalapeno in 1/2. Remove the seeds if you don't think your friends can handle the heat, otherwise leave'em and enjoy watching your friends shed a few extra tears. hehe... Depending on your pepper, you may have to slice around the stem of the pepper to create a manageable opening to squeeze the filling in. Fill either a pastry bag, or your choice of tools with the filling. Use something that will allow you to sqeeze the filling into the opening of the pepper with ease. I've used a plastic frosting tool, cookie press, and even just a small spoon to squeeze the filling in. However you choose, insert a liberal amount of filling into each jalapeno. Be careful not to overfill as the filling may spurt out during cooking. Wrap each pepper with 1 to 2 strips of bacon, securing the opening in the pepper. Secure the bacon with a toothpick (best to soak the toothpicks first, to prevent burning on the BBQ). This also helps the jalapenos from falling into the BBQ (you're bound to loose at least 1, oh well). Long metal or wood skewers also work well for large amounts. BBQ the peppers until they lightly roasted, or until the bacon is fully cooked. Use some foil to cook on if your peppers are cooking or burning too fast on a HOT BBQ. Serve 'em up and watch your friends squirm with delight! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 recipe Very Green Broccoli Soup 
 1 recipe Roasted Butternut Squash Soup 
 Fresh chives, finely sliced 
 1 1/2 pounds broccoli 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
 1 cup (1/4-inch) diced onion 
 1/2 cup (1/4-inch) diced celery 
 Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 5 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth 
 2 cups packed spinach 
 2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest 
 1 cup heavy cream or buttermilk (if using buttermilk, cut the lemon zest in half) 
 For the soup: 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/2 cup (1/4-inch) diced onion 
 1/4 cup (1/4-inch) diced celery 
 1/4 cup (1/4-inch) diced carrot 
 1 cinnamon stick 
 Sea salt, preferably gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 About 4 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth 
 1/2 teaspoon ground toasted coriander, optional 
 1 1/2 cups Roasted Winter Squash recipe 
 1/2 cup half-and-half, optional 
 About 3 pounds butternut squash (preferably 1 large squash) 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves 
 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 
 1/4 cup dark unsulfured molasses 
 2 teaspoons Toasted Spice Rub, recipe follows 
 1/4 cup fennel seeds 
 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 
 1 tablespoon peppercorns 
 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 
 1/4 cup (1-ounce) pure California chili powder 
 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 
 Instructions: 
 To serve the Harlequin Soup: Ladle some of each soup into its own pitcher. Pour both soups simultaneously into each of 6 bowls, creating a swirled almost yin-yang like appearance. Garnish with chives and serve hot. Cut the broccoli florets from the stems. Peel the tough outer skin from the stems and trim off the fibrous ends. Cut the stems lengthwise into slices about 1/2-inch thick and then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat the olive oil and butter in a soup pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and cook until light brown. Add the onion and celery, lower the heat to medium, and season with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables slowly until tender, about 10 minutes. Regulate the heat so the vegetables cook without taking on color. Add the thyme and stir. Add the broccoli stems, stock, and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for about 3 minutes. Add the florets and continue to cook until very tender, about 5 minutes more. Puree the soup in a blender in small batches. Add some of the spinach and some of the lemon zest to each batch and then puree it. (The soup can be made to this point, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat over gentle heat. Stir in the cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm. To serve: 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, optional 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds, optional Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick and saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock and the coriander, if using, and bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in the squash until smooth, then simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with stock or water when reheating.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half, if using. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm until service. To serve: Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Garnish evenly, with the cheese and pumpkin seeds, if desired. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Serving suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Variation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides up, and roast at 400 degrees F until tender. Scoop out and puree. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Taste your chili powder before adding and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chilies are almost sweet, not hot. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 1/2 pounds (about 5) hard Anjou or Bosc pears, peeled, cored and quartered 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
 Juice from 1 lemon (2 to 3 tablespoons) 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 2/3 cups granulated sugar 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup dried cranberries 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped crystalized ginger 
 All-purpose flour, for dusting 
 1 Pie Crust, recipe follows, or 2 refrigerated store-bought crusts, rolled together 
 Creme fraiche, for serving, optional 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 stick cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 
 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the pears, nutmeg and half of the lemon juice together in a bowl. Melt the butter with the remaining lemon juice, the salt and 3 tablespoons water in a heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the sugar into the skillet and stir to combine. Cook the mixture without stirring, letting it foam and bubble; the butter will separate, which is OK. Watch the mixture carefully while it cooks because once the water evaporates and the sugar begins to change color, things happen quickly. When it becomes the color of light brown sugar, about 10 minutes, remove it from the heat. Stir in the vanilla. Being careful not to burn yourself, sprinkle the cranberries and ginger into the caramel. Arrange the pears in the skillet round side-down in concentric circles as nicely as you can, fitting in as many pears as possible. Return the skillet to the burner over medium heat and cook until the pears start to soften when you poke them with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. While your pears cook, roll out your Pie Crust on a flour-dusted surface to an 11-inch circle. Cover the crust with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Lay the crust over the pears, tucking it in around the edge of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Bake until the crust is golden brown and firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Allow the tart to cool until you can handle it, about 10 minutes. Put a plate on top of the tart using heatproof pads and flip it over so the pears are on top. Slice and serve warm with creme fraiche, if using. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter in a food processor and pulse until the butter is evenly distributed but still visible in chunks. While pulsing, add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is just wet enough to hold together when pinched between your fingers. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, form into a disc and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 5 pounds russet or Yukon gold potatoes 
 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) butter, plus more for topping 
 One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened 
 1/2 to 3/4 cup half-and-half 
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, such as Lawry's 
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Peel and cut the potatoes into pieces that are generally the same size. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. (When they're cooked through a fork should easily slide into the potatoes with no resistance, and the potatoes should almost, but not totally, fall apart.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a large colander. Place them back into the dry pot and put the pot on the stove. Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all the steam to escape before adding in all the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and add the butter, cream cheese and about 1/2 cup of half-and-half. Mash, mash, mash! Next, add about 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Stir well, and then taste and add more half-and-half, seasoning salt and pepper if needed. Transfer the potatoes to a medium-sized baking dish. Throw a few pats of butter over the top of the potatoes and place in the oven until the butter is melted and the potatoes are warmed through. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 portions washed salad greens like mesclun tossed with vinaigrette or 2 Granny Smith apples, cored and cut into wafer thin rounds 
 Vegetable oil for frying 
 1/4 cup flour 
 1 egg lightly beaten 
 1 1/2 cups fresh white bread crumbs 
 Eight 1 1/2 round 1/2-inch thick disks of fresh goat's cheese 
 Instructions: 
 Prepare dinner plates with a bed of dressed mesclun salad or apple slices. In a deep pot, slowly heat to 350 degrees enough vegetable oil to completely submerge the disks when deep fried. While this is heating up, set flour, egg and bread crumbs in a 3 separate shallow plates; dip each disk of cheese in flour, then in beaten egg and finally in fresh bread crumbs, making sure breading completely adheres to all surfaces leaving no cheese exposed. With a slotted spoon or skimmer, lower the breaded cheese into the oil. Do not overcrowd or the temperature of the oil will be lowered considerably and the cheese will be greasy. Fry for 45 seconds only or until the crust is deep golden brown. Briefly drain on absorbent towels and serve immediately on garnished plates. Variations: you can marinate the goats' cheese first in a mixture of olive oil, crushed black peppercorns, herbs and garlic. Pat dry before breading. Mix some ground pecans or walnuts with bread crumbs. Before breading, sandwich an anchovy fillet or chopped canned green chilis between two 1/4inch rounds of mozzarella. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 slices whole-grain or whole wheat bread 
 2 tablespoons sliced skin-on almonds 
 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 
 Juice and zest of 1/2 orange plus other half reserved 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt 
 1 large avocado, halved, pitted, scooped and quartered 
 5 ounces baby arugula (about 8 cups) 
 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese 
 5 radishes, very thinly sliced 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread and almonds on a baking sheet, and bake, flipping the bread once, until it is toasted and crunchy and the almonds are golden, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, put the vinegar, orange juice and zest, oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a jar or other container with a lid. Secure the lid, and shake until combined. (The vinaigrette can be made a day ahead; shake well before serving.) Put an avocado quarter on each slice of toast, and mash and spread the avocado with a fork to cover. Quarter each piece of toast, and arrange the pieces on 4 plates with the points facing out to make a square. Toss the arugula, toasted almonds, feta, radishes and vinaigrette in a medium bowl. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if necessary. Put a mound of salad on top of each avocado toast square. Quarter the remaining orange half, and garnish each salad with a piece. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 6 Bosc pears 
 1 tablespoon almond Champagne 
 2 pinches ground cinnamon 
 1 hothouse cucumber, peeled and medium-diced 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cover the bottom of a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Rinse the pears, pat dry and put on a baking sheet. Cover with additional foil and roast the pears for 1 hour. Peel the pears and cut them in half. On a cutting board, cut out 12 circles from the pear halves, using a 1/2-inch circle cutter. Avoid the seeds. Shave off excess pear to make sure all of the circles are the same height. I suggest you make them a 1/2-inch high. Put the pear circles into large serving spoons. Pour some Champagne over the pears and sprinkle with cinnamon. Arrange some diced cucumber on top of each pear circle and serve.

 Ingredients: 
 6 ounces Pizza Dough, recipe follows 
 1/4 cup virgin olive oil, for brushing and drizzling 
 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh garlic 
 1/2 cup loosely packed shredded fontina 
 2 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano 
 6 tablespoons chopped canned tomatoes, in heavy puree 
 8 basil leaves 
 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 
 6 cups high-gluten flour 
 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Prepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals. On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness. When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear. Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant. The FN chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results. Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Two (1 pound each) halibut steaks (3/4-inch thick) 
 About 1/4 cup green olive paste (olivada) 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Olive oil to drizzle over the top 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove skin from steaks and the flesh away from the bone; you'll end up with 4 pieces of fish from each steak so you have 8 small fillets in all. Cut a slit on the side of each piece and stuff with some of olivada. Lightly season the two sides of the steaks with salt and pepper. Transfer them to a baking pan, drizzle the top with olive oil and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until just cooked through. Keep your eye on the fish; you really don't want to overbake it or it will dry out; the insides should have a trace of translucence in them. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
 Kosher salt 
 2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 
 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey 
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon sambal oelek, optional 
 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 
 One 8-ounce can water chestnuts, drained and coarsely chopped 
 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped 
 4 slices Cheddar 
 4 seeded burger buns 
 1/4 cup mayo mixed with 2 teaspoons sambal oelek 
 4 slices beefsteak tomatoes 
 4 slices raw red onion 
 Butter lettuce 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F to keep the first batch of burgers warm. For the burgers: Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the onions, season with salt and bring to a medium-high heat. Cook the onions until they are soft and very aromatic, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine the turkey, soy sauce, sambal oelek, ginger, water chestnuts, cilantro and the cooked onions and garlic. (Reserve the onion pan to cook the burgers in later.) Add one-quarter to one-half cup water; this will help the burgers stay nice and moist. Using your hands, squish everything together until they are really well combined. Make and cook a little tester patty to be sure that the turkey is really well seasoned. Re-season if needed. If the burger is missing salt add more soy or just give a little sprinkey dink of salt. When the burger mix is seasoned appropriately, form the mix into 4 equal size patties. Coat the saute pan with new olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Place the burgers in the pan. Be sure not to crowd the pan, if you need to work in batches go ahead! Cook the burgers for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Place the cheese, if using, on the burger and cook for 1 more minute. Toast the buns in a broiler or toaster. Schmear each side of the bun lightly with the sambaal mayo. Put a burger on each of the bottom buns and top each burger with tomato, onion and lettuce. Close up each burger, give each one a little squish and eat em' up! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup fresh orange juice (from about 2 oranges) 
 1/2 cup dried figs, stems trimmed 
 2 tablespoons raisins 
 2 tablespoons honey 
 1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 
 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1 14-ounce box refrigerated pie dough 
 All-purpose flour, for dusting 
 Confectioners' sugar, for topping 
 Instructions: 
 Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the orange juice, figs and raisins in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until hot, about 1 minute. Let sit until the dried fruit is soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the juice to a food processor, then drain the dried fruit and add to the processor. Add the honey, orange zest, lemon zest and cinnamon and pulse to make a paste. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Cut out circles using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter. Drop 1 teaspoon of the dried fruit paste in the center of each circle; fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, pinching the edges together to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork, then poke a few small holes in the top of each. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Transfer the turnovers to the prepared baking sheets; bake, switching the pans halfway through, until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Photograph by Andrew Purcell <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate 
 2 ounces semisweet chocolate 
 1 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus a little extra for greasing the baking sheet 
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 3/4 cup heavy cream 
 8 ounces white chocolate, chopped or shaved into small pieces 
 1/2 cup sour cream, preferably at room temperature 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small metal bowl, combine the 2 types of chocolate and melt them gently over a pot of simmering water or a double boiler. Cool chocolate to room temperature. Make the shortbread dough: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the butter and sugar. Blend until smooth and "creamed," 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in the cooled melted chocolate. Sift the flour and add to the butter mixture and blend on low speed to incorporate the flour. Do not over mix . Remove the dough from the bowl and refrigerate for a few minutes to chill. Make the chocolate sauce: In a medium-sized pot, bring the cream to a gentle simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the white chocolate pieces. Allow the mixture to sit and cool for a minute. All of the white chocolate should easily melt into the cream. Whisk in the sour cream and taste for seasoning. Cook's Note: Sour cream is temperamental when heated, so take care that your mixture never gets overly hot. If so, cool a little before incorporating. Set aside at room temperature. Press the shortbread dough evenly into a 9 by 13 by 1-inch greased non-stick baking pan. Place in the center of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the dough is fairly firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow the shortbread to cool for about 10 minutes. Cut into 12 rectangles, 4 by 2 inches, and then cut diagonally across rectangles to form 24 long triangles for good dipping. Arrange shortbread wedges on a tray with the white chocolate sauce in a bowl for dipping. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 duck legs 
 3 tablespoons coarse salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
 2 to 3 sprigs fresh thyme 
 2 to 3 fresh bay leaves, torn into pieces 
 3 pounds lard, melted, plus more if needed 
 8 cups mixed salad greens, for serving 
 Vinaigrette, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Rub duck legs with 1 tablespoon salt, and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with pepper and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Add thyme and bay leaves. Refrigerate covered, turning duck occasionally, for 10 to 12 hours, depending on how strong a salt cure is desired. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Rinse duck under cool running water, and pat dry. In a medium skillet over medium heat, place duck skin side down; cook until fat renders and skin browns, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer meat and reduced fat to a small casserole, placing duck skin side up in 1 layer. Add enough lard to cover. Cover casserole with a lid, and place it in the oven. Cook until duck has rendered all of its fat and the meat it is falling from the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. To preserve duck, pour a layer of fat from the casserole into the bottom of a small terrine. Pack duck on top, and strain the remaining fat from the casserole over the meat. Add additional melted lard, if necessary to cover. Be sure there are no air bubbles in the fat, or the duck will not be properly preserved. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 week to allow flavors to mellow. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place terrine in warm water to melt fat. Remove duck from fat; wiping off excess fat and reserve it for other uses (it makes a wonderful substitute for butter in savory dishes). Place duck in a shallow baking dish, and bake for 5 minutes. Pour off fat, and add to reserved fat. Continue baking until duck is very hot and the skin is crisp, 10 to 15 minutes more. Divide greens between 4 plates. Drizzle with vinaigrette, and top each bed of greens with a crispy duck leg. <|endoftext|>

 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 
 2 teaspoons brandy 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1 pinch salt 
 4 eggs, at room temperature 
 8 ounces (1 cup) very hot strong coffee 
 Brandy Whipped Cream, recipe follows 
 Chocolate bar, for shaving over 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1/4 cup powdered sugar 
 1 tablespoon brandy 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Place the chocolate chips in a blender. Add the brandy, vanilla, salt and eggs and turn on the blender. While it is blending, remove the circular disk from the blender lid and very slowly pour in the very hot coffee. (It is essential that the coffee be extremely hot in order for the final product to be the right consistency and texture.) Blend until the mixture is smooth and fairly free of visible bits of chocolate, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour the mixture into 3 large glasses, such as snifters, or 10 demitasse cups, leaving plenty of room to add a heap of whipped cream later. Place in the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 hours so the mixture has a chance to set. Before serving, spoon in the Brandy Whipped Cream and decorate with shaved chocolate Add the heavy cream and sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip until it forms soft peaks. Add the brandy and mix in. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound thick-cut bacon 
 3 tablespoons plus 2 cups light brown sugar 
 3 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
 1 1/4 cups pecans, roughly chopped 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 1/4 teaspoon table salt 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: candy thermometer Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 1 rimmed sheet pan with heavy foil and another with parchment paper. Place a baking rack over the foil-lined sheet pan and arrange the bacon slices across the rack next to each other, but not overlapping. Bake until crispy, 15 to 18 minutes. When cool enough to handle, finely chop and set aside. Reduce the oven temp to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan over moderate heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons brown sugar, about 1 minute. Add the pecans and combine until the pecans are coated. Pour out onto another unlined sheet pan and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Place the remaining 2 cups brown sugar into a 3-quart heavy saucepan, being careful to not get sugar on the sides of the pan. Add the cream, the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and salt and cook over very low heat (do not let simmer), stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until the sugar is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes. Wash down any sugar crystals on the side of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Clamp on a candy thermometer to the saucepan and boil the syrup over moderately-high heat until it registers 236 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat, leaving the thermometer in place, and let cool until the syrup registers 220 degrees F, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the bacon and pecans. Working quickly, drop 1 tablespoon of pralines onto the prepared parchment-lined sheet pan. If the mixture starts to harden, place back on the stove over moderately-low heat and let it melt. Let the pralines sit until they harden, about 45 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 24 (6-inch) bamboo or wooden skewers 
 3/4-pound New York strip steak or fillet, trimmed 
 1/2 cup soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon honey 
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon red chili flakes 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 
 2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil 
 2 cloves garlic 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 
 1 teaspoon peeled and minced fresh ginger 
 1 whole green onion, finely chopped 
 1 cup chicken stock 
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon honey 
 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce or your favorite barbecue sauce 
 1 teaspoon red chili flakes 
 Instructions: 
 Soak the bamboo or wooden skewers in water for 30 to 60 minutes. Drain and pat dry. With a sharp knife, cut the steak into 24 long, thin strips. Thread 1 strip onto each skewer, weaving the skewer back and forth along the length of each steak strip. Arrange the skewers on a large platter or baking tray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. About 30 minutes before you wish to grill the skewers, combine the soy sauce, honey, chili flakes, cumin, turmeric, and oil in a small bowl. Pour this marinade over the steak skewers, turning to coat the meat evenly. Leave the steak skewers to marinate at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Preheat a hinged grill or panini maker, according to the manufacturer's instructions, or preheat a broiler, outdoor grill or stovetop grill pan. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the garlic cloves and blanch them in the boiling water for 30 seconds to a minute to remove some of their harshness. Drain the cloves well, pat them dry with paper towels, and chop them finely. In a small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger and green onion and saute just until they begin to soften and smell fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the stock, soy sauce, honey, hoisin or barbecue sauce, and chili flakes and bring to a boil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Pour the sauce through a strainer into a clean pan and, over medium heat, whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, a little bit at a time. Keep warm. Grill the skewers (in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding) until cooked through and nicely browned, about 2 minutes total on a hinged grill or panini maker or 2 minutes per side in the broiler, in a grill pan, or on an outdoor grill (1 minute if you want the meat rare). Take care that the skewers don't prevent a hinged grill or panini maker from closing properly. Transfer to a platter, pour on the sauce, and serve; or serve with the sauce on the side for dipping. <|endoftext|>

 2 cups sugar 
 5 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks 
 3/4 cup buttermilk 
 2 tablespoons finely ground cornmeal 
 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 cup brown butter, cooled 
 Nonstick cooking spray 
 All-purpose flour, for dusting 
 1 egg, whisked 
 Dragees, for decorating 
 Edible glitter, for decorating 
 Royal icing, for decorating 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a 9-inch pie pan a docker or fork pie weights or dry beans cookie cutters For the crust: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar and salt. With the mixer running, drop in the butter and mix until the mixture resembles wet sand. In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and egg yolks, then pour into the mixer and whip until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a clean cutting board and cut in half. Using your hands, gently push each half of dough into a disc and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. For the cookie dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter with the sugar. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then add the vanilla and salt. Add the flour, a little at a time, until incorporated. Divide the dough into small batches and color each with food coloring, as desired. Chill the dough for 1 hour before rolling. When ready to decorate the pie, roll the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Use cookie cutters or a knife to cut out shapes for decorating the pie. For the filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the sugar, eggs and yolks until the mixture turns a light, golden color. Then whisk in the buttermilk, cornmeal, flour, cinnamon, vanilla and salt. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the browned butter. For the pie: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie pan with cooking spray. Gently dust a clean work surface with flour, then place a pie dough disk on top and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the dough to the pie pan, then crimp the edges and prick the dough on the bottom with a docker or fork. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans to weigh the dough down. Bake until the dough just sets, 8 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Working quickly, use a pastry brush to brush the crust with egg wash. Carefully pour the filling into the crust. Bake the pie until set but slightly jiggly, about 35 minutes, covering the edges of the crust with foil to prevent burning after about 10 minutes. Add the cookie dough topper decorations to the pie, then bake for 10 minutes more. Check the pie at about 40 minutes total; the center should still have a jiggle to it, but it should seem mostly set. Cool completely before decorating the pie with dragees, glitter and icing. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Meatloaf 
 Whole-wheat bread, sliced 
 Mayonnaise, mustard or tomato jam 
 Instructions:

 Ingredients: 
 1 (12-ounce) can cola, flat (recommended: Coke) 
 1/2 cup fresh or frozen/thawed peeled peach slices 
 2 to 4 teaspoons prepared horseradish (adjust as necessary to produce a more or less spicy glaze) 
 Pinch freshly ground black pepper 
 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 
 1 1/4 cups yellow quick cooking grits (recommended: Bob's Red Mill Corn Grits/Polenta) 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 6 tablespoons drained and chopped pimientos 
 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar 
 1 sweet potato 
 Peanut oil, for frying 
 Kosher salt 
 1/2 small Vidalia onion (or other sweet onion), peeled 
 1/3 cup sugar 
 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
 1/3 cup olive oil 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 3 cups fresh watercress, washed and dried 
 6 (approximately 8-ounce) bone-in, fully cooked smoked pork chops (recommended: Smithfield) 
 Olive oil, for brushing on chops 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Begin the components of this meal by beginning with the following: Bring cola to a boil over high heat in a large wide, shallow saucepan. Bring chicken broth to a boil over high heat in a large deep pan. Bring 2-inches peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven. Preparing the glaze: Once cola is boiling, continue to cook vigorously, over medium-high heat, until it's reduced to about 1/3 cup and becomes slightly syrupy, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the cola is reducing, place the peach pieces into a blender and puree. Once the cola has reduced, stir in the horseradish, peach puree, and pepper. Set aside. The glaze will have the consistency of a thin syrup. Preparing the grits: Once the chicken broth comes to a boil, slowly whisk in the grits and stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Continue to cook the grits over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until they are soft and thick, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the pot and allow the grits to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup cream, pimientos, and cheese, and stir to combine. Just before serving, check the consistency of the grits. Stir in the additional 1/4 cream, if necessary, to thin them out. Prepare the sweet potato frizzles: Peel and grate the sweet potato using the large holes in a box grater. Using a tea towel, squeeze as much liquid as possible from the potato. Carefully drop the dry potato shreds in the oil once it reaches 350 degrees F. Fry for about 1 minute, until crispy and lightly browned. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season lightly with salt. Prepare the watercress salad: Grate the onion using a box grater. In a jar or shaker, mix the onion, sugar, vinegar, oil, and salt. Shake vigorously until blended. Just before plating the salad, drizzle about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the dressing over the watercress and toss gently to coat. Preparing the chops: (Note the chops are fully cooked, so the preparation is to give them color, glaze them, and heat them through.) Preheat a large grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush each chop with about a tablespoon of oil, and season scantily with salt and pepper. Be cautious about oversalting the chops, since they are generally salty. Place the chops on the grill pan. Allow to sear for about 1 to 3 minutes, and then rotate the chop to get nice hash marks on the chop for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chops over. Cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes total. Reduce heat. A few minutes before serving, spoon about a teaspoon of glaze over each chop. Turn over and repeat, being careful not to burn the glaze. To serve: Place a mound of the grits on each plate. Lean a chop next to the grits. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sweet potato atop the grits/chop. On the side of the chop, mound a serving of the dressed watercress. Drizzle a tablespoon or so of the glaze over the chop and allow it to run into the grits. <|endoftext|>

 Edible food lacquer (see Cook's Note) 
 Grenadine syrup, as needed 
 Mineral water, as needed 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a gram scale, food grade silicone glassware molds, a syringe and an immersion blender For the caviar spherification: In a medium bowl and using an accurate gram scale, measure 5 grams of calcium chloride and dissolve it in 500 milliliters of water. In another bowl, gradually sprinkle 5 grams of sodium alginate into 500 milliliters of water or juice. Let the alginate hydrate for 2 minutes. Add 1.5 grams of sodium citrate. Blend thoroughly with an immersion blender and strain if needed. This is your "batter." Tint the batter your desired color and flavor with your desired flavoring. Squirt the batter into the calcium chloride firming solution using a syringe, dragging to create "intestines" and dropping drips to create "platelets." Lift out the pieces of batter with a strainer and rinse carefully with clean water. Set the pieces aside. For the edible glassware (if making): Preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 275 degrees F. Melt the isomalt in a 4-cup heatsafe glass liquid measuring cup in the microwave on high for 3 minutes. Stir, then melt in 1-minute increments until the isomalt is completely liquid. Hold in the heated oven or toaster oven for 10 minutes to release all the bubbles. Pour the isomalt into a food grade silicone glassware mold, then pour out any excess into the measuring cup. Let the mold cool completely. Unmold the glassware, then spray the inside with the food lacquer until completely covered. Drain upside-down on a cooling rack (to let any excess food lacquer drip out) until completely dry. Repeat for as many edible glasses as you need to make. For the zombie drink: Put some "intestines" and "platelets" into each edible glass or regular glass. Pour 1 tablespoon grenadine syrup into each glass, then add enough mineral water to fill. If serving in the isomalt glasses, serve immediately, as the drink will slowly dissolve the glasses; they won't last more than 20 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups shelled pistachios 
 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk 
 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 
 1 1/3 cups sugar 
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Place the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, shaking the baking sheet occasionally, until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and allow to cool slightly. Roughly chop, then cool completely. In a mixer, beat together the butter, vanilla, salt, eggs and egg yolk. Add the flour, sugar and baking powder and mix on low until a rough dough begins to form. Add the pistachios and chocolate chips and continue to mix. If the dough seems dry, add some cold water a teaspoon at a time. If the dough is too wet, add a pinch of flour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured cutting board and knead gently to make sure the chocolate chips and pistachios are evenly distributed. Divide the dough in half, and shape each into a 10-by-3-inch log. Place onto one of the prepared baking sheets and bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Let the biscotti rest until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Slice the logs into 3/4-inch pieces, and arrange them on the baking sheets, cut-side down. Bake until toasted and golden on top, about 25 minutes. Flip them over and continue to bake until dry and just barely golden brown, another 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes. Biscotti will keep in an airtight container for 2 weeks. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup butter 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 4 1/2 cups whole milk 
 Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Cook's Note: This is an important moment, as you have to slowly toast the flour without burning it. This will help you lose the flowery taste. Warm up the milk and gradually ladle into the pot with the butter-flour mixture, whisking constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Season the sauce with freshly grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup steel-cut oats 
 1 1/4 cups boiling water 
 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 
 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 2 eggs 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup oat bran 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 cup apple sauce 
 1 pound cream cheese 
 1 cup powdered sugar 
 1/4 cup honey 
 1/2 to 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, toasted 
 Instructions: 
 In a saucepan, place the oats and the water and simmer 15 minutes to soften slightly. Allow to cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter a 8-inch square cake pan. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment, cream the butter until smooth. Add granulated sugar and mix until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix just until combined. Add the cooked oats and mix just until combined. In another bowl, mix the flour, oat bran, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Working in 3 batches, add the dry ingredients to the butter-oat mixture, alternating with the applesauce mixing just until combined after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out dry and almost clean (a few crumbs are fine), 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool completely. Turn cake out onto a square serving platter. Place strips of paper under the cake around all the edges. To make the frosting, in a mixing bowl with a whip attachment cream the cream cheese on medium to high speed until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the powdered sugar and honey. Frost the cake on the sides with a thin layer of frosting then use the remaining to cover the top and swirl it decoratively. Using your hands, press the toasted chopped nuts onto the side of the cake to coat it. Remove the paper strips before serving. Cut into 2-inch square pieces. Notes about the recipe: This is a delicious hearty and healthful cake. The texture added by the cooked steel cut oats makes you thing there are nuts inside. I made it to help me use up ends of jars of oat bran in the freezer and steel cut outs in the cereal drawer after the hot cereal breakfast season was over for the year. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (1 1/4 to 1 1/2-pounds) flank steak 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried 
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 1 bunch or 1/2 bunch each fresh parsley and cilantro, leaves picked and chopped 
 6 or 8 thin carrot sticks or 1 medium carrot 
 1 cup pitted green olives 
 1 medium red onion, sliced 
 1 bunch watercress, trimmed 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Use a boning knife to butterfly flank steak: Working across the grain, make a cut down the center, but only halfway through meat. At the top of that cut, make perpendicular cuts, one in each direction, this time with the grain. Again, cut only halfway into steak. Repeat perpendicular cuts at the other end of the center cut. Cuts should resemble the letter H. At the top of the original center cut, hold the knife parallel to the meat and insert knife. Slice toward you, making a pocket. This cut should almost reach the outer edge, halfway through the meat's thickness. Repeat on other side. Open the flaps. Season meat liberally on both sides with salt and pepper, then place it cut-side up, wide side facing you. Season with marjoram, cumin and garlic and cover it with a fairly even layer of parsley-cilantro mix. Then arrange carrots, olives, and onions horizontally over the full width of the meat. Scatter a relatively even layer of watercress over all. Roll meat up from the bottom like a jellyroll; grain of steak should run length of roll. Tie in 3 or 4 places with butcher's twine. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or roasting pan large enough to accommodate rolled steak. Deeply brown it on all sides, about 15 minutes total, then transfer pan to oven and roast for about 30 minutes, until meat is cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes before serving. Or, put meat in a clean baking dish, weight it with a plate with something heavy on it and chill overnight. Take matambre from refrigerator and slice it into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces about 1 hour before serving at room temperature. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 cups (10 1/2 ounces) dried figs, diced 
 1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm water (85 degrees to 90 degrees F) 
 2 2/3 cups (12 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 
 1 2/3 cups (6 1/2 ounces) cake flour 
 1 3/4 cups (5 1/4 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats 
 2 tablespoons baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 1/3 cups (11 ounces) maple syrup 
 1 1/3 cups (11 ounces) milk 
 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 
 2 large egg yolks 
 3/4 cup (6 ounces) canola oil 
 2 cups (8 ounces) walnut pieces, toasted 
 Additional maple syrup for glazing 
 Instructions: 
 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the diced figs in a medium bowl and add the warm water. Let soak until softened. Whisk the unbleached flour, cake flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. Put the maple syrup, milk, eggs, egg yolks, and canola oil in a medium bowl and stir with the whisk to combine. Add the mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a spoon just until all the flour is moistened. This should be a wet batter, because the oats absorb a lot of the liquid during baking. Fold the walnuts and figs into the batter (the figs do not need to be drained). Divide the batter evenly between two oiled 9- by 5-inch loaf pans. Bake for about 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (If your oven bakes unevenly, rotate the pans from left to right and front to back about halfway through the baking time.) Remove the pans from the oven and use a pastry brush to glaze the tops of the loaves with maple syrup. Set them on a rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Turn the loaves out of the pans and set them on the rack to cool completely before serving. Wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. They may also be frozen, wrapped first in aluminum foil and then in plastic wrap or a heavy-duty freezer bag. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup quartered vine-ripened grape or cherry tomatoes 
 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 6 ounces medium-large shrimp, shelled and deveined 
 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/2 small clove garlic, minced 
 Instructions: 
 In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside while you saute the shrimp. Put the shrimp in a pie pan and pat them completely dry with a paper towel. Arrange the shrimp so they lay flat and are evenly spaced in the pan. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Season one side of the shrimp with salt and pepper; add the oil to the pan and turn the heat to high. Invert the pie pan over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Saute the shrimp, undisturbed, until they turn golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic to the pan. Turn the shrimp over with tongs. Turn the heat off and cook the shrimp for 1 minute in the residual heat of the pan. Shake the pan to combine the shrimp with the garlic and then transfer them to the bowl with the tomato mixture.

 Ingredients: 
 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 
 1/4 cup store-bought crumbled bacon bits 
 1/2 cup mascarpone 
 1/2 cup halved seedless grapes 
 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Unfold puff pastry and cut into 3 equal pieces along the fold. Roll each sheet out slightly. Using a 2 1/2-inch cutter, cut 4 rounds out of each strip, giving you 12 rounds total. Using a 1 1/2-inch cutter, press into each round, making a solid indentation without cutting completely through the pastry. Place rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and top with a baking rack. This will keep the rounds uniform and even as they puff up during baking. Bake until rounds are golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Using the tip of a spoon, carefully remove the inner circle of the puff pastry creating a nest. Fill each nest with 1 teaspoon of the bacon bits and top with 2 teaspoons of the mascarpone. Garnish with grape halves and a sprinkle of parsley. Serve on individual plates or a serving platter. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound russet (baking) potatoes (about 2) 
 5 cups water 
 4 medium leeks 
 1 medium onion, chopped 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 2 cups milk 
 2 cups half-and-half or light cream 
 3/4 pound poblano chili peppers (about 4 large), roasted (procedure follows) 
 1 cup sour cream 
 1/4 cup fresh lime juice, or to taste 
 Garnish: Halved lime slices 
 Instructions: 
 Peel and dice potatoes and in a bowl combine with water. Discard dark green tops of leeks and chop remaining leeks. In another bowl soak leeks in water to cover, agitating occasionally to dislodge any sand, 5 minutes. Lift leeks out of water and drain in a colander. In a heavy kettle cook leeks and onion in butter over low heat, stirring occasionally, until leeks are softened. Add potatoes with water and salt and simmer, covered, 40 minutes, or until potatoes are very soft. Add milk and half-and-half or cream and bring just to a boil, stirring. In a blender puree soup with 1/2 cup chilies in batches until smooth, straining as pureed through a very fine sieve into a large bowl, and stir in sour cream and lime juice. Chill soup, covered, until very cold and up to 1 day. Cut remaining chilies into small dice. Serve soup garnished with lime slices and diced chilies. TO ROAST PEPPERS: Using a long-handled fork, char peppers over an open flame or on a rack set over an electric burner, turning, until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes. (Alternatively, broil peppers on rack of a broiler pan under preheated broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes, or until skins are blistered and charred.) Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle. Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end. Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs. (Wear rubber gloves when handling chilies.) <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 dried Anaheim chiles 
 1 ancho chile 
 2 dried chipotle chiles 
 2 tablespoons fennel seeds 
 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 
 4 to 6 black peppercorns 
 1/2 to 3/4 cup smoked paprika 
 1/4 cup garlic powder 
 1/4 cup light brown sugar 
 3 tablespoons kosher salt 
 5 pound flat end piece brisket (thinner end, not the point piece which is the fat end of the brisket) 
 6 cups applewood smoking chips, soaked in water 
 3 ancho chiles, stems removed 
 2 large white onions, thickly sliced 
 5 cloves garlic 
 1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) 
 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. To make the spice rub: In a large dry skillet, toast the chiles, fennel seeds, coriander seeds and peppercorns over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add to a spice grinder and run until you have a fine powder. In a large mixing bowl combine the spices with the remaining rub ingredients. Makes about 2 cups. Rub the brisket all over with the spice rub mix. Wrap tightly in plastic and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line a large roasting pan with foil and set over high heat. Put the soaked chips on top, then put the pan directly over the burner to get the chips to start smoking, about 10 minutes. Place a V-rack over the top of the chips and put the marinated brisket on the rack. Cover the entire top of the roaster with foil, crimping the edges to form a nice seal, (you may have to use 2 strips foil to cover everything). Reduce heat to medium and smoke the brisket for 15 minutes. While the brisket is smoking, prepare the anchos, onion, garlic and tomatoes. Remove brisket from the roasting pan with the rack. Remove the chips with the foil and discard in sink (pour water on top of chips to stop the smoking). Put the reserved chiles and vegetables on the bottom of the pan, then put the rack with the smoked brisket in the roasting pan so it sits above the aromatics. Put in the middle of the oven and roast until brisket is tender, about 4 to 4 1/2 hours Remove brisket from oven and set aside to rest. Add the pan drippings and the vegetables from the bottom of the pan to a blender and puree. Stir in the red wine vinegar and transfer the sauce to a serving dish. Slice the brisket across the grain, arrange on a serving platter and serve with sauce. <|endoftext|>

 1 cup/250 ml extra-virgin olive oil 
 Splash red wine 
 1 cup/250 ml lukewarm water, or as much as you need 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the flour on a worktable. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil, wine and water. Combine the ingredients and knead until the mixture becomes an even dough. If necessary, add a little more water and continue kneading. Cut off a small amount of dough and roll into a 1/2-inch thick log. Cut the log into 5-inch long pieces. Then form a 'doughnut-like' shape by pinching the opposite ends together. Repeat the above process with the remaining dough. Place the taralli in a pot of boiling water for about 1 minute or until they float to the surface. Stir to prevent them from sticking together. Remove the taralli from the water with a slotted spoon and dry off any excess water with a dishcloth.

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs 
 6 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly warm 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 2 whole eggs 
 2 egg yolks 
 1/4 dark brown sugar 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 3 tablespoons melted unsalted butter 
 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree 
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 
 1/2 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped and reserved 
 Bourbon-Maple Whipped Cream 
 1 1/4 cups very cold heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons Grade B maple syrup 
 1 to 2 tablespoons bourbon (to your taste) 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add all the ingredients for the crust to a food processor and pulse until combined; it should feel like wet sand, and just come together. Spread the mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie pan, using your finger tips or the flat bottom of a glass. Firmly press the mixture over the bottom and sides of the pan. Put the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the crust is light brown and firm to the touch, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Whisk together the eggs, yolks and sugars in a large bowl. Add the butter, pumpkin, cream, spices, salt and vanilla seeds and whisk to combine. Strain the mixture into a bowl. Pour the strained mixture into the baked pie crust and bake until almost set, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove and let come to room temperature. Refrigerate until chilled, if preferred. Cook's Note: The filling makes more than what is needed to fill the pie shell. You are able to freeze the excess. We made a double batch and it filled 3 pie shells very comfortably. For the whipped cream: Combine the cream, vanilla seeds, syrup and bourbon in a large chilled bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Garnish each piece of pie with a dollop of the whipped cream before serving. <|endoftext|>

 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 4 tablespoons cottonseed oil, preferable, or vegetable oil, in all 
 1 1/2 cups chopped red onions 
 1/2 cup fresh poblano chile peppers, seeded and chopped 
 1/2 cup fresh Anaheim chile peppers, seeded and chopped 
 1/2 cup fresh red (preferably, or use green) jalapeno chile peppers, seeded and chopped 
 3/4 cup corn flour 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup cornmeal 
 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1 large egg, beaten 
 1 1/2 cups milk 
 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature 
 1 cup Cheddar, freshly grated 
 1 cup Monterey Jack, freshly grated 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. In a 12-inch skillet over high heat, combine the butter with 2 tablespoons of the oil. As soon as the butter melts, add the onions, all the chile peppers, and 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons of the seasoning mix. Stir well, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature. The mixture should be a golden tan color, the onions a medium tan brown, and the peppers dark red and dark green. The vegetables retain a slight crunch. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. While the vegetables are cooling, make the cornbread batter. Combine the corn flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and the remaining seasoning mix in a large bowl. Add the egg, milk, melted butter, 1/2 cup each of the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack, and the vegetable mixture. Mix until just combined. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons oil into a 12-inch cast-iron skillet. Make sure that the oil covers the entire bottom of the skillet; lift and roll the skillet if necessary. Heat the oil just until it begins to smoke, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the batter to the skillet, the mixture will begin to sizzle right away. Remove the skillet immediately and sprinkle the top of the batter evenly with the remaining 1/2 cup each Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Bake until a knife inserted into the middle of the cornbread comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 stick butter, softened 
 Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 bunch chives, left whole 
 4 (8-ounce) filet mignon steaks 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Spoon the butter out onto the center of the plastic wrap and place the chives in the center on top of the butter. Pull the edge over the butter mixture, and tightly pinch the ends, then holding the plastic wrap tightly at each end, pull the mixture towards you. This should create a tight sausage shape. (or imagine rolling a sushi roll) Chives will be in the center surrounded by butter. Tie a knot on both ends of the butter roll and place into the freezer until you are ready to place it on top of your cooked filet. Season the filets with a little salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium-high until the pan is hot then drizzle with olive oil.. Place the filets into the pan and cook to medium-rare, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Remove the pan from the heat and pour brandy into the skillet. Carefully tilt skillet towards the flame to flambe. When the flames burn off, remove the filets from the pan. Remove butter from freezer and cut 4 thin coins and place one on each filet. Serve steaks while hot. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup basmati rice 
 1 cup black bean dal* or lentils 
 3 cups water 
 5 tablespoons plain yogurt 
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
 2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 
 2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, diced 
 1 small red onion, diced 
 1/2 bunch cilantro, stems trimmed, roughly chopped 
 1/3 cup vegetable oil 
 Yogurt, for garnish 
 Tomatoes, chopped, for garnish 
 Cilantro, chopped, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Pick over the rice and dal to remove any pebbles or dirt. Process in a food processor or blender until it becomes a coarse flour mixture, about 5 minutes. Combine this mixture with water, yogurt, and salt in a bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place at least 12 hours or as long as 24. When ready, the batter should be smooth and foamy, a bit thinner than pancake batter. Just before cooking, add the tomatoes, serrano chiles, red onion, and cilantro. Stir to combine. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small, well-seasoned cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Pour in 1/3 cup batter, reduce the heat to low, and spread the batter evenly with a ladle or spatula. Fry until well browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat this procedure, heating an additional teaspoon of oil each time, until all the batter is fried. Stack the pancakes between layers of aluminum foil in a roasting pan and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven. To serve, arrange 2 pancakes on each plate and top with some yogurt, tomatoes, and cilantro. For smaller servings, slice each pancake into quarters and serve with garnishes for dipping. <|endoftext|>

 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 3 whole cloves 
 1 whole star anise pod 
 3 stalks celery, finely chopped 
 5 cloves garlic, 3 minced and 2 sliced 
 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 
 8 ounces coarsely ground beef chuck 
 8 ounces coarsely ground pork butt 
 1 1/4 cups white wine, divided 
 3/4 cup evaporated milk 
 3 cups beef broth 
 1-ounce dried porcini mushrooms, finely chopped 
 2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes 
 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
 2 teaspoons dried basil 
 2 teaspoons dried marjoram 
 2 tablespoons tomato paste 
 1 tablespoon ketchup 
 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 
 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
 1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan 
 1 gallon water 
 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1/2 pound dry spaghetti 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the meat sauce: Place an 8-quart Dutch oven over low heat and add the bacon. Cook slowly until the bacon is crispy and has rendered its fat, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan for another use. Add the onion, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Place the clove and star anise into a small spice bag, add to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions caramelize, 45 to 60 minutes. Add the celery and the 3 cloves of minced garlic to the pan and continue to cook over low heat until the celery is semi-translucent, approximately 30 minutes. Remove the spice bag from the pot. Meanwhile, place a wide 4-quart saute pan, over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and once it shimmers, add the beef chuck and the pork butt and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the meat to a colander to drain. Return the pan to high heat, add 1/2 cup of the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Transfer these bits and any remaining wine to the Dutch oven along with the meat. Add another 1/2 cup of the wine, evaporated milk, beef broth, and mushrooms to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Once the sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours, place the 4-quart saute pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once it shimmers, add the 2 cloves of sliced garlic and cook for 30 to 45 seconds or until fragrant. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Add the tomatoes, oregano, basil, and marjoram and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, approximately 30 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup wine, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high; add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the tomato mixture to the meat mixture and stir to combine. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, while preparing the pasta. For the pasta: Bring the water and salt to a boil over high heat. Carefully add the pasta, stirring quickly to separate. Cover and return to a boil, being careful that the water does not boil over. Once boiling again, uncover and continue to cook until slightly less than al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain in a colander. Add the pasta to the meat sauce and cook, over low heat, for another 2 to 3 minutes or until the pasta is al dente. Add the Parmesan cheese and toss to combine. Transfer pasta and sauce to a serving bowl or individual bowls and serve. <|endoftext|>

Pour into 4 tumblers with or without ice and garnish with the mint or lemongrass. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 cups all-purpose or pastry flour, plus more if needed for rolling 
 1 tablespoon chopped chives 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 3/4 cup cold salted butter, cut into chunks 
 3/4 cup cold vegetable shortening, cut into chunks 
 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar 
 1 large egg, lightly beaten 
 2 leeks, tops and bottoms trimmed, cut in half lengthwise 
 16 ounces white mushrooms, sliced 
 2 tablespoons salted butter 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 8 large eggs 
 2 cups grated Swiss cheese 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 tablespoon pesto 
 8 thin slices prosciutto (or any good ham), chopped 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the chive pie crust: Mix the flour, chives and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and work them into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Using a fork, stir in the vinegar, beaten egg and 5 tablespoons cold water. Stir the mixture until just combined. Shape the dough into 2 discs. (You'll only be using 1 disc for this recipe. You can wrap the additional dough in plastic wrap for storage; it will keep up to a week in the fridge or up to 6 months in the freezer.) Have ready 2 sheets of parchment paper that are each at least 12 inches square. Place the disc of dough between them. (If the dough is sticky for any reason, don't worry. Just sprinkle some flour on the parchment to get started. You shouldn't have to add much for it to stop sticking.) Starting at the center, roll the pin out to the edge. Turn the dough and parchment as necessary and continue rolling, always from the center to the outer edge. After a couple of rolls, lift the parchment paper away from the dough to loosen and replace the parchment. Flip the whole thing and loosen the other paper sheet. Continue rolling until the dough is large enough for your pie pan. For the filling: Slice the leeks thinly, and then soak them in cold water for about 10 minutes to remove any grit or dirt. Drain well. Put the mushrooms on a large baking sheet. Roast until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, saute the leeks in the butter until golden brown and beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. For the quiche base, add the cream and eggs to a medium bowl and whisk them to combine. Stir in the leeks, mushrooms, grated Swiss and some salt and pepper. Mix in the pesto and prosciutto. The mixture should be very thick! Pour the mixture into the pie shell, then cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too brown on top. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the quiche to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. Place the quiche on a cutting board and slice wedges with a serrated knife. Delicious for breakfast, and even better for lunch with a salad and a bunch of juicy grapes! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/4 pound bacon 
 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 
 2 large Vidalia onions, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds 
 4 large green tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 6 ounces sharp white Cheddar, grated, about 1 1/2 cups 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Render bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Transfer the cooked bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Add the bread crumbs to a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet and stir into the bread crumbs. Add the onion rounds to the skillet in batches and cook, without breaking the round slices apart, until there is some golden color, about 5 to 6 minutes per side. To assemble the gratin, overlap the green tomato slices in 1 row in a large baking dish, about 9 by 11 inches. Next, make a row slightly overlapping of the partially cooked onion rounds, being careful to keep the slices intact. Repeat steps until all tomatoes and onions are used. Season tomatoes and onions lightly with salt and heavily with pepper. Crumble the bacon over the vegetables; sprinkle the grated Cheddar over the top followed by the bread crumbs. Bake until the cheese is bubbly, about 30 to 45 minutes. If the top is getting too brown, loosely cover with foil. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves 
 2 teaspoons minced garlic 
 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
 1 teaspoon ground coriander 
 1/2 cup olive oil 
 Salt and pepper 
 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 
 1 teaspoon Cilantro Pesto 
 1/2 cup olive oil 
 Salt and pepper 
 1 ripe mango, peeled and sliced 
 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 
 1 tablespoon honey 
 Pinch salt 
 4 small flour tortillas 
 1 (12-ounce) package queso anejo 
 1 head Boston lettuce, washed and roughly torn 
 1 head red leaf lettuce, washed and roughly torn 
 Instructions: 
 Pesto: Roughly chop the cilantro, making sure not to get too much of the stem. Place it in the bowl of a food processor along with the garlic, crushed red pepper, and coriander. With the processor running, add the oil in a slow stream. Let the processor run for about 30 seconds. Add salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse to combine. Set aside. Vinaigrette: Pour the lime juice into the cleaned bowl of the processor. Add the Cilantro Pesto and, with the processor running, add the oil in a slow stream. Process until the vinaigrette emulsifies. Add salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse. Set aside. Mojo: Place all the ingredients into the cleaned bowl of the processor and run until smooth. Set aside. Assembly: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread a generous amount of pesto on each of the 4 tortillas, making sure that you spread the pesto almost to the edge of each tortilla. Shred a generous amount of the queso onto each tortilla. Spray a small saute pan with cooking spray and set it over moderately high heat for 2 minutes (you want to make sure the pan is very hot). Place 1 tortilla, cheese side up, into the pan and cook, shaking occasionally, for 1 minute. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the other 3 tortillas. Place the baking sheet in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. As the quesadillas are cooking, toss the lettuces together in a large bowl with 1/2 of the vinaigrette (reserve the rest for pork loin dish). Mound the salad onto 4 plates. Remove the quesadillas from the oven, allow to cool for a few minutes, and slice each into 4 pieces. Surround the salad with the 4 slices and drizzle with the Mango Mojo. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/3 recipe sugar dough, recipe follows 
 1/2 pound unsalted butter, slightly softened 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 3 eggs 
 2 tablespoons orange liqueur 
 2 oranges, zested and finely grated 
 1 teaspoon almond extract 
 2 cups ground almonds 
 1/4 cup currant jelly, melted 
 2 baskets strawberries, sliced 1/4 inch thick 
 1 pound unsalted butter, slightly softened 
 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) pastry flour 
 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) all-purpose flour 
 Pinch salt 
 3/4 cup (6 ounces) sugar 
 3 egg yolks 
 2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll the pastry 3/8-inch thick and line a 10-inch flan ring with it. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and chill it until needed. Cream the butter and sugar lightly in an electric mixer; don't let the butter get too soft. Add the eggs and mix lightly. Stir in the liqueur, zest, and almond extract, then mix in the ground almonds. Pour into the chilled pastry shell and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the pastry and marzipan are a deep golden brown. Remove the tart from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Brush the top of the tart with the currant jelly. Cover the top of the tart with sliced strawberries arranged in concentric circles or in a flower petal design, making certain the whole top of the tart is covered. Remove the flan ring and transfer the tart to a flat serving platter. Cut into wedges. Sugar Dough: 1 pound unsalted butter, slightly softened 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) pastry flour 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) all-purpose flour Pinch salt 3/4 cup (6 ounces) sugar 3 egg yolks 2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream Cut the butter into large pieces and place the pieces in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or dough hook. Add the pastry and all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar. Mix on low speed until the butter is evenly distributed throughout the flour. Add the egg yolks and cream. Continue to mix on low speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough and divide it into 2 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 6-inch round. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. Use as needed. The dough will remain fresh for 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator; or wrap securely in plastic, then in foil, and it will keep frozen for 2 to 3 months. Note: The dough may also be made in a food processor using the same technique, but make half a batch at a time for best results. To prepare the dough by hand, place the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl or on a work surface. Mix together. Cut in the butter with your fingertips. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour in the egg yolks and cream. Using your fingertips, quickly work in the flour until the dough holds together. Form the dough into rounds, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill. Yield: 2 1/2 pounds <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Canola oil, for frying 
 12 round wonton wrappers 
 1 cup fine julienne scallions 
 1/2 cup brown rice vinegar 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 3 tablespoons soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons Korean chile flakes 
 2 tablespoons sesame oil 
 12 cloves garlic 
 3 onions, cut into chunks 
 1 1/2 cups soy sauce 
 1 cup red wine 
 1/4 cup sesame oil 
 2 pinches black pepper 
 2 Korean pears or Gala apples, cored and cut into chunks 
 1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cubed 
 1 pound beef rib eye, sliced thinly 
 1 Korean pear or Gala apple 
 1 cup prepared kimchee, drained well and minced 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a taco shell mold For the taco shells: Pour enough canola oil in a heavy pot or deep fryer for the wonton wrappers to be submerged completely when frying. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Using a taco shell mold, fry the wonton wrappers in the oil until crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool fully before using. For the scallion slaw: Rinse the scallions thoroughly with cold water. Prepare a bowl of ice water, add the scallions and soak for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Combine the scallions, rice vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, chile flakes and sesame oil and let marinate for 20 minutes. For the bulgogi marinade: Add the garlic and onions to a food processor and process until thoroughly combined. Add the soy sauce, red wine, sesame oil, black pepper, pears, pineapple cubes and 1 1/2 cups water and process until thoroughly combined. Add the rib eye to a bowl, pour over the bulgogi marinade and allow the beef to marinate for at least 10 minutes. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Remove the beef from the marinade, letting any excess marinade drip back into the bowl. Add the beef to the pan and cook until well done, about 5 minutes. (This is very important to allow the flavors of the marinade to develop completely.) Peel the pear and slice it into thin half-moons. Place a layer of the kimchee and then the beef into each taco shell. Garnish with the scallion slaw and sliced pears. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 scant tablespoon or 1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast 
 1/4 cup warm water (about 110 degrees F) 
 3/4 cup heavy cream 
 3 large egg yolks 
 1 large egg white 
 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 
 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold 
 Apple Pecan Filling, recipe follows 
 1 large egg white 
 Sliced almonds 
 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 I'm partial to Granny Smith apples because I like their tart flavor and they keep their shape during baking 
 1 cup light brown sugar, packed 
 2 cups finely chopped, peeled and cored Granny Smith apples 
 1 cup finely chopped pecans 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 Instructions: 
 For the Topping: For the Dough: In a large measuring cup or medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast in the water to soften. Heat the cream to 100 degrees F and add it to the yeast along with the egg yolks and egg white. Whisk to combine. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, salt, cardamom, and flour. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is the size of tiny peas. This process also can be done easily in a food processor. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not mix too much because you do not want to soften the cold butter. You should see small flour-coated pieces of butter throughout the dough. Overnight rise: Put the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap and a tightly woven towel and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight. Shape: Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Roll each half into a 24-inch square. Fold the dough in half from top to bottom, then fold the dough in half from side to side to make a 12-inch square. Cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes. Working with 1 square of dough at a time, roll the dough into a 12 by 24-inch rectangle. Spread half of filling evenly over two-thirds of the dough, filling an area of 8 by 24 inches. Fold the portion of dough that has no filling onto the center third of filled dough, then fold the other third of dough to the center, forming a 4 by 24-inch rectangle. Place the dough seam side down on a parchment-lined or well-greased baking sheet. Bring the ends of the dough almost together (about 4 inches apart) to form a horseshoe. Repeat with the second piece of dough. If you cannot get both Kringles on a baking sheet, cover the second one and put it in the refrigerator until the first Kringle finishes baking; then bake. Second Rise: Cover the with a tightly woven towel and let rise for 1 hour. Preheat Oven: About 10 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

 Ingredients: 
 3 1/2 cups water 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup Polenta Taragna 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 4 ounces Tallegio cheese, sliced 
 Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Bring the water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to moderately low so that the water comes to a simmer. Begin pouring in the polenta taragna by the handful, in a thin stream, very slowly, and stir constantly with a long handled wooden spoon to avoid lumps. Keep the mixture at a bare simmer and stir frequently. (It is not necessary to stir constantly if the polenta is cooked on low heat.) After all the polenta is added, stir in 3 tablespoons of the butter and cook the polenta for 20 to 25 minutes. As it cooks, the polenta will thicken considerable; just keep stirring, and crush against the side of the pan any lumps that might form. The polenta is done when it comes away effortlessly from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in half of the cheese, the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, and pepper. Season to taste. Add remaining cheese and stir quickly, leaving some of the cheese unmelted. Transfer the polenta to a serving platter and serve immediately.

 Ingredients: 
 4 sticks (32 tablespoons) unsalted butter 
 3 cups sugar 
 2 large eggs 
 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 
 4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2 to 3 tablespoons milk 
 2 cups multi-colored puffed rice cereal (I like Fruity Pebbles!) 
 Instructions: 
 Cream the butter, sugar and eggs: In a stand mixer or in a large bowl with a hand mixer on high, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs one by one, completely incorporating the first one before adding the second, and making sure to scrape the sides between additions. Beat in the almond extract. Add the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, stir to combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Lower the mixer speed to medium-low and pour the flour mixture into the butter mixture in four parts, taking time to blend in and scrape the sides of the bowl back to the center between each addition, until all is combined. Finish the dough and chill: Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to the dough and blend until it becomes smooth but firm enough to form balls (you may not need all of the milk). Turn off the mixer and add the cereal, folding it in by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Divide the dough in half and roll into logs 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Bake and cool the cookies: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F; line two baking sheets with parchment. Remove the cookie dough from the plastic wrap and slice into 1/2-inch-thick discs. Place 6 discs at least 3 inches apart on each prepared baking sheet (refrigerate the remaining dough until ready to bake). Bake until golden and crispy around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets. Once the baking sheets are cool, bake the remaining cookies. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 8 Roma plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise and seeds removed 
 4 bunches broccoli rabe (rapini), divided into 8 sections 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided plus more for coating potatoes 
 2 finely diced shallots, or 1 white onion, finely diced 
 1 (750-ml) bottle Marsala 
 1 cup vegetable stock 
 1 tablespoon freshly chopped thyme leaves 
 8 (6-ounce) boneless chicken breasts, skin on 
 8 ounces smoked mozzarella, sliced 
 6 to 8 white potatoes, scrubbed and cut into chunks 
 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick) 
 1/2 bunch fresh chives, chopped 
 Instructions: 
 To roast vegetables, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place tomatoes and rapini on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper and coat with 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Roast the vegetables until tender, then remove and allow to cool. Begin the Marsala sauce by heating 1/4 cup of the oil in a saute pan and cooking the shallots or onion gently until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the stock and fresh thyme. Allow to reduce by 2/3. For the stuffed chicken, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you "butterfly" them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. Lay sliced smoked mozzarella on each breast followed by broccoli rabe and roasted tomatoes. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place in the oven and roast until fork tender about 45 to 50 minutes. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, and coat with olive oil. Place in the oven and roast potatoes until they are also fork tender. Strain Marsala sauce and whisk in butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Remove any toothpicks securing the chicken. Slice each chicken roll to reveal the stuffed interior. Place on serving plate with roasted potatoes. Spoon Marsala sauce around chicken. Garnish with chopped chives. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup whole milk 
 Kosher salt 
 1 cup cornmeal (1/2 cup medium grind, 1/2 cup fine grind) 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Assorted finely chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme and rosemary, for topping

 Ingredients: 
 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, lightly pounded 
 Coarse salt and cracked black pepper 
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
 4 garlic cloves thinly sliced 
 1/2 cup orange juice 
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 
 Instructions: 
 Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a 10-inch non-stick pan over medium high. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic begins to turn golden, about 1 minute. Do not let the garlic burn, keep moving it around. Place the chicken on top of the garlic and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the chicken over and add the orange juice and thyme. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and the orange juice is slightly reduced, about 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and place on a cutting board. Reduce the orange juice more at this time, if necessary. Slice chicken into thin strips. Pour sauce over chicken. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 5 cloves garlic 
 One 3-inch chunk peeled, fresh ginger 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup vegetable oil 
 1/4 heaping teaspoon whole cloves 
 10 green cardamom pods 
 8 whole allspice 
 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half 
 1 bay leaf 
 1 medium yellow onion 
 2 teaspoons Madras-style curry powder 
 1/2 jalapeno, or more to taste 
 3 pounds mixed skinless, bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks (separated) 
 1/2 cup whole, peeled, canned tomatoes (with puree), roughly chopped 
 2 cups cold water 
 Serving suggestion: Basmati rice and chutney 
 Instructions: 
 In a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the garlic and ginger and puree to a paste. Heat the oil in a stew pot or Dutch Oven over medium-high heat. Add the cloves, cardamom, allspice, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf and cook, stirring constantly, until dark and fragrant and the cinnamon stick unfurls, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic-ginger paste, curry powder, and jalapeno and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 minute. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the tomato and chicken and cook, stirring, until the oil begin to separate and there is a distinctive crackling sound as the ingredients "re-fry" in the oil, about 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, until the chicken is lightly browned, about 7 minutes more. Add the water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and stew for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and tender and the liquid thickens into a sauce, about 30 minutes more. Transfer chicken curry to a serving bowl and serve with rice and chutney. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup loose jasmine tea leaves 
 1/4 cup loose oolong tea leaves 
 1 cup milk 
 3 cups heavy cream 
 2 Tahitian vanilla beans, split lengthwise and scraped 
 1/2 cup honey 
 10 eggs, separated 
 1/2 cup cornstarch 
 1/2 cup sugar (1/4 cup for yolks, 1/4 cup for whites) 
 6 to 8 buttered and sugared 6 ounce ramekins 
 3 cups milk, reduced with lemongrass to 2 cups yield 
 4 stalks chopped lemongrass, white part only 
 1/2 pound sugar 
 1 Tahitian vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped 
 3/4 cup egg yolks 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 In a non-reactive saucepan on low heat, mix teas, cream, milk and vanilla beans/pods and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes then take off stove and let steep an additional 30 minutes. Strain infused liquid and re-heat with the honey to a simmer. In a stainless steel bowl whisk together the 10 yolks, cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar. Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot infused cream to the yolks. Mix well then add tempered mixture back to the saucepan. On medium heat, whisk constantly until it thickens then cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes. A pastry cream texture should be achieved. Transfer base to a baking dish, seal with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Base can be made 24 hours in advance. Pre-heat a sheet tray in a 375-degree oven. Whisk the egg whites with 1-tablespoon of sugar in an upright mixer equipped with a whip attachment on slow. In about 8 to10 minutes soft peaks will be achieved. Add the rest of the sugar and whip at high speed for two 5 second bursts. In a large stainless bowl, hand whisk the chilled infused cream base until smooth. Using a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites. Work quickly, but do not over mix. The base needs to be one homogenous color. Fill ramekins to the top. Drop each one from a height of 3 inches onto the counter to disperse any unwanted bubbles. Place on heated sheet tray and bake for 12 minutes. After 6 minutes the souffles will start rising. Check the rising souffles to see if any edges are getting caught on the rims of the ramekins; if necessary open the oven door and carefully slice the sticking part with a paring knife (you won't ruin the souffles if you work fast). The souffles will straighten themselves out. When the sides of the souffle are golden brown (the key to a souffle not falling is the crusty, golden brown sides), pull out of the oven and dust the tops with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately with a scoop of lemon grass ice cream. In a non-reactive saucepan, simmer milk with lemon grass and reduce by 1/3 percent. If there's enough time let the lemon grass steep in the milk overnight. Strain out lemon grass and heat with sugar and vanilla bean/pod. Bring to scalding. Hand whisk the yolks in a stainless steel bowl. Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot milk to the yolks. Mix well then add tempered yolks back to the sauce pan. Whisk constantly on medium heat for 2 minutes. Strain and cool in an ice bath. When mixture is cooled add heavy cream. Follow manufacturer's instructions for your particular ice cream maker. Place in freezer before serving. PLATING: Place souffle on plate. Cut an opening in the top of the souffle and put a scoop of ice cream inside.

 310 grams (about 2 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour 
 10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking soda 
 5 grams (1 teaspoon) baking powder 
 600 grams (about 3 cups) sugar 
 180 milliliters (about 3/4 cup) vegetable oil 
 6 grams (1 teaspoon) kosher salt 
 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) vanilla extract 
 3 large eggs 
 360 milliliters (about 1 1/2 cups) buttermilk 
 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter 
 2 cups sugar 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Italian Meringue Buttercream: 
 369 grams (about 1 3/4 cups) sugar 
 125 grams (about 1/2 cup) water 
 20 grams (about 1 tablespoon) light corn syrup 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 170 grams egg whites 
 Pinch cream of tartar 
 452 to 565 grams (4 to 5 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed, at cool room temperature 
 2 tablespoons vanilla bean paste 
 Chocolate Feuilletine Crunch: 
 4 ounces great-quality dark chocolate 
 4 ounces great-quality milk chocolate 
 2 to 4 ounces feuilletine flakes 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: three 9-inch cake pans; a candy thermometer For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter three 9-inch cake pans and dust with cocoa powder, shaking off the excess. Mix the chocolate into the hot coffee in a medium bowl and stir to melt. Set aside to cool completely. In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside. Combine the sugar, oil, salt and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed, 3 to 5 minutes. (This batter is fluid and tends to get lumps; mix carefully with the paddle, or even use the whisk attachment on low speed to avoid lumps.) With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape the bowl and continue mixing on medium-low speed until fully incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. (Don't worry about overmixing at this stage; you need to make sure the batter base is fully mixed.) Stir the buttermilk into the coffee mixture. In alternating batches, add the flour and buttermilk mixtures to the batter base. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix. The batter should be thick but fluid. Stir or mix by hand to get rid of any lumps; strain if you feel compelled. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely. For the toffee: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the butter, sugar and salt in a heavy-bottom saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-high heat to 300 degrees F (the hard crack stage), 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour over the prepared baking sheet and let cool completely. Break into small pieces, then process into a powder using a food processor or coffee grinder. For the buttercream: Combine 339 grams of the sugar, the water, corn syrup and salt in a heavy saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium, being careful not to let the flames go up the sides of the saucepan. The target temperature for the syrup is 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When the syrup has reached 230 degrees F, run the mixer on medium speed until the egg whites get frothy. Sprinkle the remaining 30 grams sugar into the egg whites and continue to whip on medium speed. (The egg whites should increases in size and form soft peaks by the time syrup reaches 250 degrees F.) Once the syrup reaches 250 degrees F, increase the mixer to high speed and carefully pour the hot syrup down the side of the bowl, being sure not to hit the whip. Whip the mixture until it has cooled to room temperature, 5 to 10 minutes. Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment. Gradually beat in the butter, a few cubes at a time, on medium-low speed. Mix until the buttercream comes together, then mix in the vanilla bean paste. Mix 3 to 4 ounces of the powdered toffee into 1 cup of the buttercream and set aside. For the chocolate feuilletine crunch: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the dark chocolate and milk chocolate in a double boiler. Remove from the heat and mix in the feuilletine. Spread on the prepared baking sheet and let cool. Crumble into bite-size pieces. Set aside. To assemble the cake: Set one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread with a thin, even layer (about 1/4 inch) of the buttercream, then spread with a thin, even layer (1/8 to 1/4 inch) of the toffee-buttercream mixture. Top with feuilletine crunch. Repeat with the remaining layers. Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing 
 3 1/2 pounds ground beef 
 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, preferably gray salt, plus more for sprinkling 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling 
 6 ounces soft, fresh goat cheese, at room temperature, such as Laura Chenel's 
 Nonstick spray, for spritzing 
 One 16-ounce round loaf country bread 
 Grilled Bing Cherry-White Balsamic Sauce, recipe follows 
 2 cups whole Bing cherries, stemmed 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 
 6 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 
 2 tablespoons brown sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt, preferably gray salt 
 Pinch freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Fine-mesh grill basket or all-metal strainer Preheat a gas grill to high or ignite the charcoal. When the grill is hot, clean your grill rack. Decrease the temperature to medium-high (for a gas grill only) and brush or wipe a little oil on the grill rack. Divide the ground beef into two equal portions. Line a 9-inch-round cake tin with plastic wrap. Gently push half the beef into the tin. Don't press too hard. Place another sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and invert the tin so the shaped beef patty pops out onto the plastic wrap. Line the cake tin with plastic wrap again. Gently push the remaining half the beef into the tin and keep it in the tin for the moment. Sprinkle the top of each patty with the salt and pepper. Spoon the cheese onto the patty still in the tin. Spread the cheese to cover the meat, but leave about 1/2-inch margin uncovered around the edge. Use the plastic wrap-lining to remove the patty from the tin and flip it onto the non-cheese patty. You want the seasoned sides of the meat facing together, with the cheese sandwiched between. Lightly press the 2 patties together all around the edge. Sprinkle the top of the burger with salt and pepper. Wipe a pizza peel with a little oil and transfer the burger to the grill using the peel. Close the grill lid and cook until the bottom of the patty shows grill marks, 8 to 9 minutes. Spritz a little nonstick spray on top of the burger, then flip and cook, 8 to 9 minutes. Gently transfer the cooked burger to a large platter and let rest, about 15 minutes. Halve the bread straight across horizontally so it forms a bun. If you like, you can toast both halves lightly on the grill. Transfer the burger onto the bottom half of the bread. Spoon on the Grilled Bing Cherry-White Balsamic Sauce and close the burger with the top half of the bread. Slice the burger into 6 wedges, as if you were cutting a pizza, and serve. A fresh grind is just as important. Choose chuck steaks from your butchers and ask them to grind the meat while you wait, the same day you plan to cook them if possible. Even your local supermarket butcher will be happy to do this for you. Summer fruit, when given a quick turn on the grill, gets a smoky, sultry tang that works well with goat cheese on a burger. This also works well as a topping for a turkey burger, chicken breast or a grilled pork chop or pork loin. Dark red Bing cherries are beautiful in this sauce but you can also use a combination of cherries with apricots, peaches or any stone fruit. I like to grill cherries and then pit them; you lose less juice that way. For stone fruit, cut the fruit in half, remove the pit, give the fruit a light rub of olive oil on both sides and then grill, about 2 minutes each side. Preheat a gas grill or charcoal grill to medium-hot heat. A charcoal grill will glow red under gray ash when at this temperature. (Alternatively, grill the cherries in a hot grill pan over high heat on the stove.) Pour the cherries into a fine-mesh grill basket or all-metal strainer, and place the basket over the grill. Cook until bright and smoky, but not charred, about 4 minutes. Give the basket a good shake every 20 to 30 seconds, so the cherries heat through. After 3 minutes, taste a cherry to see if it's smoky enough. Take the basket off the heat and let the cherries cool, about 5 minutes. Halve the cherries over a bowl, reserving all the cherry juice you can. Discard the pits. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large saucepan or skillet, either on the grill or the stove. When the butter is foaming, add the shallots and stir. Cook the shallots until they begin to show some color, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and brown sugar. Add the cherries to the saucepan with any reserved juice. Cook until just slightly syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add the salt and pepper, taste, and add more seasoning if you like. This can be stored in the fridge, tightly covered, for 3 to 4 days. Yield: about 2 cups. <|endoftext|>

 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 1 cup prepared kimchee, drained well and chopped 
 2 tablespoons fish sauce 
 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 
 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 
 2 large eggs 
 12 ounces ground chuck (80/20) 
 12 ounces ground pork (80/20) 
 1 cup canola oil 
 1/2 cup rice flour 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 large shallots, thinly sliced 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 5 large shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps coarsely chopped 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 
 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 
 2 large green onions, dark green and pale green parts, thinly sliced 
 Juice of 1 lime 
 Unsalted butter, for frying eggs 
 8 large eggs 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. For the spicy glaze: Whisk together the gochujang, honey and soy in a small bowl; set aside. For the meatloaf: Heat the canola oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the ginger, red chile flakes and garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the kimchee and toss to combine. Remove to a plate and let cool for 10 minutes. Whisk together the fish sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil and eggs in a large bowl. Add the kimchee mixture and mix to combine. Add the beef and pork and gently mix to combine. Put the mixture on the prepared baking sheet and form into a loaf about 12 inches long by 6 inches wide by 2 inches thick. Brush the top with the spicy glaze and bake until golden brown and the internal temperature registers 155 degrees F on a meat thermometer, about 1 hour. Loosely tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. For the fried shallots: Put the canola oil in a small saucepan and heat until it registers 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Whisk together the flour and 1/2 cup water and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the shallots in the batter, transfer to the oil with a slotted spoon and fry until crisp and golden brown. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt. For the shiitake mushroom salad: Heat the canola oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl, add the cilantro, soy sauce, sesame oil, green onions and lime juice and mix to combine. For the fried eggs: Melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a medium nonstick saute pan. Crack 2 eggs at a time into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until the whites are set and the yellows are partially set. Gently flip over and cook for 30 seconds longer. Repeat with the remaining eggs, adding more butter as needed. Slice the meatloaf into 1 1/4-inch slices, put on individual plates and top each slice with a fried egg, fried shallots and cilantro leaves. Serve with the shiitake mushroom salad on the side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (7 to 9 pound) 4-rib beef rib roast (prime rib), trimmed 
 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 
 2 teaspoons paprika 
 2 teaspoons chili powder 
 2 tablespoons fajita seasoning 
 2 tablespoons Irvine Spice Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning 
 1 fresh lemon 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 fresh lemon, halved and seeds removed 
 1/4 cup prepared horseradish 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/8 teaspoon white pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Rinse meat to remove residue and pat dry with paper towels. Prepare a rub by combining cayenne, paprika, chili powder, fajita seasoning, and Smokey Rotisserie seasoning in a small bowl. Squeeze lemon juice into bowl to make a paste and rub over entire surface of prime rib. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the smoker. General rule of thumb is to maintain a temperature range of 255 to 300 degrees F (indirect heat), and smoke for 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound of meat. Beat heavy cream with an electric beater until stiff peaks form. Squeeze in lemon juice, 1/2 of lemon at a time, and beat in until incorporated. Then gradually beat in horseradish and salt and pepper. Chill for about an hour before serving. Slice down prime rib and serve with horseradish cream. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Olive oil mister or nonstick pan spray 
 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 
 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds 
 3 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut 
 2 tablespoons lightly packed light brown sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 3 tablespoons coconut oil (if solid, microwaved until melted) 
 1/2 cup plain reduced-fat Greek yogurt 
 1/3 cup almond butter 
 2 tablespoons honey 
 1/2 cup vanilla- or chocolate-flavored whey protein powder 
 3 tablespoons roasted almonds, roughly chopped 
 1/4 cup dried cranberries 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with olive oil or nonstick pan spray. Mix the oats, sunflower seeds, coconut, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. In another medium bowl, stir together the coconut oil, yogurt, almond butter, and honey. Add the yogurt mixture to the oat mixture and mix until the two are thoroughly combined. Stir in the protein powder, almonds, and cranberries. The mixture will be sticky. Spread the mixture into the prepared dish and bake for 15 minutes. Take the pan out of the oven and let the -mixture cool slightly, then slice it crosswise into 10 bars. Carefully remove the bars from the baking dish and use a spatula to transfer them to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the bars start to turn golden, about 15 minutes longer. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, transfer the bars to a wire rack, and cool completely. (Wrap in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 1 week.) <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 15 littleneck clams (plus a few extra in case some don't open) 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 1/4 cup corn meal 
 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic 
 1 tablespoon minced ginger 
 1/2 cup green zucchini, 1/4-inch dice 
 1/2 cup yellow zucchini, 1/4-inch dice 
 2 pounds pork brisket, 1/2-inch dice 
 2 tablespoons paprika 
 1/2 cup medium diced onions 
 2 tablespoons Chinese black beans, rinsed, drained and chopped 
 1/2 cup shaoxing wine 
 1 cup white wine 
 4 cups chicken stock 
 2 lemons, juiced 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 1 1/2 cups Idaho potatoes, 1/4-inch dice (square off the potato, no peeling necessary) 
 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 
 2 cups curry oil, to fry 
 2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 8-ounce portions 
 Canola oil, to cook 
 Salt and black pepper, to taste 
 1/2 cup curry powder 
 Water, to make runny paste 
 Pinch salt 
 2 cups canola oil 
 Instructions: 
 Place the clams, salt and cornmeal in a bowl and completely cover with cold water. Let them soak and purge for 1 hour. Drain, rinse and set aside. In a hot saute pan, coat lightly with oil and saute half of the garlic and ginger. Add the zucchinis and caramelize, about 3 minutes. Remove from pan and add drained clams. Deglaze with half of the wine and shaoxing and cover. Add a little water if needed if clams do not fully open. Once clams are open, set aside. (discard any that do not open). Keep liquid. Wipe pan out and coat with oil on high heat. Season the pork brisket with salt and paprika and brown on all sides. Add onions and caramelize. Add black beans. Deglaze with remaining shaoxing and wine and reduce by 50 percent. Add chicken stock and half of the reserved clam juice. Check for seasoning and add more clam juice if necessary. Bring to a simmer and reduce by 60 percent. Check again for seasoning and add zucchinis and clams. Add lemon juice and whisk in butter. Check one more time for flavor. While the sauce is reducing, season the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper and sear in a hot, oiled pan. Brown well on all sides and finish in a 375 degree oven until medium, about 10 minutes. For the potatoes, heat the curry oil to 375 degrees and first blanch the potatoes until lightly brown. This can and should be done in advance. Right before serving, fry again, this time until golden brown, drain well, season with salt, and toss with cilantro. (frying it twice produces a very crisp product). PLATING Using an o-ring in the center of the plate, fill with the pork sauce. Top with fried potatoes. Cut each pork tenderloin into 3 equal pieces and surround ring. Pull ring off and serve. Make a paste with curry powder, water salt and slowly add oil. Let stand for 1 hour to settle. Use top, yellow oil for garnish or frying. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 
 1/2 cup blackberries 
 1/2 cup raspberries 
 1 loaf crusty bread, such as baguette, French loaf, etc. 
 4 whole egg yolks 
 2 cups half-and-half 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 Zest of 1 lemon 
 Butter, for frying 
 Sifted powdered sugar, for serving, optional 
 Maple syrup, warm, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 For the berry butters: In separate batches, whip 2 sticks butter on high in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment. Switch to the paddle attachment. Add the blackberries. Turn the mixer to low for only about 5 seconds, just long enough for the berries to begin to mix in and break up, but not so long that it turns into a mess. Clean the mixer bowl and attachments and repeat with the remaining 2 sticks butter and the raspberries. With each batch, turn the berry butter out onto a long sheet of plastic wrap set over a long sheet of foil. First seal the plastic wrap around the cylinder, and then secure the foil around it. Twist the ends, gradually applying more pressure as you twist in order to make the cylinder taut. Once it's a nice, neat cylinder of foil, place into the freezer for 30 minutes in order to quickly solidify it. Then transfer to the fridge until you're ready to use. The butter should be very firm. For the French toast: Cut the bread into slices 1/2-inch thick. In a dish, whisk the egg yolks with the half-and-half, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, coating both sides. Then remove from the dish and set aside. Repeat until all the bread is coated. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sizzle some butter in the skillet when hot. Cook the French toast on both sides until golden brown, being careful not to burn. Remove the berry butters from the fridge. Unwrap one end and cut some slices. Lay one slice onto each serving of French toast. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired, and then drizzle with maple syrup. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 2/3 cups sugar 
 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 
 1 stick unsalted butter, cubed 
 1 cup heavy cream, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt 
 1/2 stick unsalted butter, cubed, plus more for the pan 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/4 cup corn syrup 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 cup pecan pieces 
 1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2 cups cake flour 
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 3/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 3/4 cups sugar 
 4 large eggs 
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 
 5 large egg whites 
 2 pounds unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt, for sprinkling 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two standard muffin pans with 24 cupcake liners. For the salted caramel: Combine the sugar, 1/3 cup water and the corn syrup in a small saucepan. Stir with a wooden spoon and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, swirling the pot occasionally, until the mixture is a beautiful amber color (watch closely). Once the desired color is reached, immediately add the butter and stir with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated. Remove from the heat. Add the heavy cream and stir to incorporate. Stir in the coarse salt. Pour 1/2 cup of the salted caramel into a small bowl or measuring cup, and the remainder into another bowl. Cool completely, stirring occasionally. (You can speed up the cooling by putting the caramel into the refrigerator, but it must be pourable when you are ready to assemble the cupcakes.) For the brittle: Butter a small baking sheet and set aside. In a small but deep saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, butter and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a full boil over high heat, and boil until a candy thermometer reaches 280 degrees F. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the baking soda, and then the pecans. Pour onto the prepared pan and spread with a rubber spatula. Top with the coconut. Allow to cool. Break the brittle into pieces of desired size. For the cupcakes: In a medium bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and kosher salt and set aside. Combine the milk and vanilla and set aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Once incorporated, add the eggs, one at a time, at low speed. Be sure to incorporate after each addition, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Do not over beat. Once incorporated, add the flour mixture and the milk mixture. Alternate with three parts flour and two parts milk, being sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary (we don't want any butter chunks stuck to the bottom). Using a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner with batter. Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pans to cooling racks and cool for about 5 minutes, and then transfer the cupcakes to the racks to cool completely before filling and frosting. While the cupcakes are baking, make the buttercream: Combine the sugar and egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl over simmering water and whisk continuously until the sugar is melted. Remove from the heat, place under the mixer with a whisk attachment and whisk at medium-high speed until soft peaks form and it cools to room temperature. Add the butter and beat until incorporated. With the mixer running, slowly beat in the 1/2 cup reserved salted caramel until the mixture is homogenous. Set aside at cool room temperature until you are ready to frost the cupcakes. To assemble: Use a small serrated knife, core each cupcake about 1 1/4 inches wide at the top and halfway into the cake. (Discard the cores-or nibble while you work.) Fill each with about 1 tablespoon of the remaining salted caramel. Sprinkle with about 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt. Frost each cupcake with a generous amount of caramel Swiss buttercream and garnish with crumbled pecan coconut brittle. Eat. <|endoftext|>

 1 pound peeled butternut squash chunks (about 3 cups) 
 1/2 cup red quinoa, rinsed well 
 1 bunch collard greens, stems removed and leaves cut into thin ribbons (about 8 cups) 
 4 ounces fresh goat cheese, crumbled 
 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped 
 6 pickled sweet piquante peppers, such as Peppadews, finely chopped 
 1 large crisp apple, chopped 
 1/3 pound deli-sliced honey-baked ham, cut into bite-size pieces 
 2 cups sweet potato chips, slightly crushed 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: A straight-sided 3-quart tall glass bowl or four 16-ounce wide-mouth glass jars with lids Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans out on a rimmed baking sheet, and roast until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, and roughly chop. Turn the oven up to 425 degrees F. Transfer the pecans to a medium bowl. Add 1/3 cup of the vinegar, the mustard, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and whisk to combine. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking constantly, until blended into a vinaigrette. Spread the squash out on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the pecan vinaigrette, sprinkle with a large pinch of salt and toss to combine. Roast until the squash is fork-tender and browned in spots, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool. (The squash can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead.) Meanwhile, combine the quinoa and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, cover, adjust the heat to medium-low and cook until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan. (The quinoa can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead.) Put the collards in a medium bowl, and add the remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Rub the vinegar and salt into the collards, and let sit until the greens are tender, about 30 minutes, tossing and massaging again about halfway through. Combine the goat cheese, parsley and piquante peppers in a small bowl. Using a straight-sided 3-quart tall glass bowl for 1 large salad or four 16-ounce wide-mouth glass jars for 4 individual salads, make a first layer with the quinoa, then add the following in separate layers: half the collard greens, the roasted squash, the goat cheese mixture, the apples, the ham, and the remaining collard greens. Top with the sweet potato chips. (The salad, except for the chips, can be put together, covered and refrigerated up to 2 hours ahead; top with the chips right before serving.) If making 1 salad, just before serving, transfer it to a large bowl, toss with the remaining pecan vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. If making 4 salads, add vinaigrette to each jar, season with salt and pepper, cover with the lid and shake to coat. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 dried ancho chiles 
 4 dried guajillo chiles 
 4 dried pasilla chiles 
 2 chipotle chiles in adobo plus 2 tablespoons sauce 
 8 ounces thick sliced bacon, chopped 
 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 One 4- to 5-pound boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch chunks 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 medium onions, chopped 
 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 
 1 tablespoon ground cumin 
 2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican 
 2 teaspoons paprika 
 One 16-ounce can chocolate stout 
 3 cups low-sodium beef stock 
 Finely chopped onion, thinly sliced scallions, sour cream and chopped fresh cilantro, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Remove the stems and seeds from the ancho, guajillo and pasilla chiles. Heat a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat and toast the chiles in batches until they just start to darken and become shiny, 10 to 20 seconds per side. Remove the chiles to a large bowl. When all of the chiles are toasted, pour boiling water over them to cover and let stand until soft, about 30 minutes. Puree the chiles with the chipotles, adobo sauce and 1/2 cup soaking water in a blender until smooth. (Reserve the remainder of the soaking water.) Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, then drain on paper towels. Pour off the oil from the skillet and add the vegetable oil. Sprinkle the beef all over with some salt and pepper. Working in batches, brown the beef in the fat over medium-high heat, 3 to 4 minutes per batch, and remove to a plate as it browns. Reduce the heat to medium low and add the onions to the drippings in the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are almost tender, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook, 2 minutes more. Add the cocoa, cumin, oregano and paprika and stir to coat the onion, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to high and add the chile puree. Cook until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stout, bring to a boil and boil until reduced by about a quarter, about 3 minutes. Add the beef and bacon. Pour in the stock and add enough reserved chile soaking water or additional water (about 2 cups), to cover the meat by about 1 inch. Set the cover ajar and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Serve the chili in bowls garnished with onion, scallions, sour cream and cilantro. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 quart strawberries 
 1/3 cup sugar 
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
 2 cups self rising cake flour 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 1 stick unsalted butter 
 2/3 to 3/4 cup buttermilk, milk or heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons buttermilk 
 2 tablespoons soft butter 
 Instructions: 
 Place the berries in a colander and quickly rinse them under running cold water. Pour them on a pan or tray lined with several thicknesses of paper towel to drain for 5 minutes. Hull the strawberries with the point of a stainless steel paring knife, then slice them into a bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar and lemon juice, then set aside, covered at room temperature for an hour or two. Whip the cream (add a couple of tablespoons of sugar, if you like) until it holds a soft peak, cover and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and set rack in the middle level. In a food processor combine the self-rising flour and sugar and pulse to mix. Add the butter, cut into 8 to 10 pieces, and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and make a well in the center. With a fork stir in the buttermilk, being careful not to over work the dough. Let the dough stand for a minute or 2 to let the flours absorb the liquid. Flour the work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Fold the dough over on itself 2 or 3 times, until it is smooth and less sticky. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a 9-inch disk on parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual shortcakes, pat the dough into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle and cut into 8 (3-inch) biscuits with a sharp, floured round cutter. Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Paint the tops with the buttermilk and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden brown. Check the center of the large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure it has baked through. If the pick emerges with dough clinging to it, lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the large shortcake onto a platter immediately after it is baked. Use a sharp, serrated knife to slice through the middle, making two layers. Slide the edge of a cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the top layer off. Butter the bottom layer and pour on all but 1/2 cup of the berries. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining berries on the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and place the bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top with about 1/3 cup berry mixture. Replace tops and pour a tablespoon or so on the top. Serve immediately, passing the cream in a bowl for the guests to help themselves. <|endoftext|>

 1 large egg white 
 Pecan Pie Filling: 
 1 1/3 cup pecan halves 
 1/2 cup light corn syrup 
 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 1 large egg 
 Fine salt 
 3 Granny Smith apples 
 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 
 Pumpkin Pie Filling: 
 1 cup pure pumpkin puree 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 1/3 cup granulated sugar 
 1 large egg 
 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 
 Unsweetened whipped cream, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: A 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan; pie weights, uncooked rice or dried beans For the crust: Position the oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Roll the pie dough out, if needed, into a 10-inch round on a lightly-floured surface (or between two pieces of floured parchment paper). If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm up. Ease the dough into the prepared pie pan. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges as desired. Chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the pecans out on a baking sheet and bake until golden and toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool and separate 1/3 cup; coarsely chop the 1/3 cup pecans for garnish and set aside. Put the pie pan on a baking sheet and line the chilled pie crust with foil or a large coffee filter and fill with pie weights. Bake until the edges are just barely golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the foil with weights, then brush the bottom and edges of the dough all over with the egg white and continue baking until the bottom of the crust is also just barely golden, 8 to 10 minutes more. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. (Par-bake your pie shell up to 1 day in advance.) For the pecan pie filling: Scatter the remaining 1 cup pecans in the bottom of the cooled pie shell. Whisk the corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, egg and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the pecans. Bake until just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack until cool to the touch. For the apple pie filling: Meanwhile, peel, core and cut the apples into 1/4-inch slices. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, then add the apples and cook, gently stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft but still hold their shape, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour and cool completely. (Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet in a thin layer to help cool faster). Pile the cooled apple mixture up and around the edge of the cooled pie (directly on top of the pecan filling) leaving about an 8-inch well in the center of the pie. For the pumpkin pie filling: Whisk together the pumpkin, heavy cream, granulated sugar, egg and spice in a medium bowl. Pour the filling into the center of the pie (directly on top of the pecan filling) with the apples as a border. Bake the pie until the pumpkin center is set with just a slight jiggle, 50 minutes to 1 hour. If the crust gets too brown, cover with foil or a pie crust shield. Let the pie cool completely on a rack. Sprinkle the reserved 1/3 cup chopped pecans around the pie, snug up against the apple filling. Slice and serve with dollops of whipped cream. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (3 to 3 1/2-pound) spaghetti squash 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 4 boneless skinless skate wing fillets 
 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground 
 Flour, for dusting 
 3 cloves garlic, smashed 
 Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 
 1 pint Brussels sprouts, each sprout pulled apart into leaves 
 1 bunch cilantro, leaves picked and coarsely chopped 
 1 lemon, cut into wedges 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush the halves with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper. Arrange them on a sheet pan and roast them, flesh side down, until the outside of the squash can be easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and keep in a warm place. Add olive oil to a large saute pan until it is about 1/4-inch deep, and put over high heat. While the oil is heating, pat the skate dry with paper towels. Season the fish with salt and the ground coriander seed. When the oil is very hot but not yet smoking, dredge the skate wings in flour and shake of the excess. The fish should go IMMEDIATELY from the flour to the oil, no pausing! If all the fish will not fit in the pan at the same time, only flour the ones that will fit in the pan. Premature flouring will result in a gummy gritty skate wing. The oil should be hot and sizzling when the fish goes in. Cook each piece of fish until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and blot immediately on paper towels. Season with salt, to taste. If working in batches, keep the cooked fish warm in a preheated 225 degree F oven. While the fish is cooking, coat another large saute pan with olive oil, add the smashed garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden brown and aromatic, remove it and discard. Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan and season them with salt. Saute the sprouts until they get very brown and crispy. Using a large fork, scrape the flesh out of the spaghetti squash, it should look like...spaghetti! Add it to the frizzled sprouts and season again with salt. Stir together and toss in the chopped cilantro, reserving a little to garnish the fish. Arrange some of the squash/and sprout mixture on each serving plate. Lean the crispy skate next to it and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice. Let's go skating! <|endoftext|>

 2 large eggs 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 1 container red, green and white sprinkles 
 Instructions: 
 Put the cherries, pistachios and brown sugar in a food processor and pulse until a fine crumb forms (take care not to over process or the filling will clump together). Set aside. Put the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, baking powder and salt and beat for another minute. Lower the speed to medium and add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time; beat until smooth. Cover and place in the fridge to chill, about 1 hour. Divide dough the in half and flatten each into squares. Put one portion of dough in between two 12-by-12-inch sheets of parchment paper dusted with flour. Roll out into a 1/8-inch-thick square. Remove the top parchment sheet and sprinkle half of the cherry-pistachio filling evenly across the dough. Pat into an even layer. Tightly roll into one large log (using the parchment to help you). Trim the ends and then roll the exterior in a mixture of sprinkles to coat. Repeat with the remaining dough, filling and sprinkles. Tightly cover in fresh parchment and refrigerate overnight (preferred) or at least 4 hours, until the dough is firm. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment or a silicone baking mat. Remove and uncover the dough logs and slice with a very sharp knife into 1/4-inch-thick pinwheels. Arrange about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until slightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool on a wire rack. Store for up to 3 days in an airtight container, or freeze cookies for future use, up to 2 weeks. Enjoy! <|endoftext|>

 4 (1 1/2-inch thick) slices whole grain bread 
 2 egg whites 
 1 whole egg 
 Butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray 
 Instructions: 
 Heat the canola oil and butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet. Once the foam from the butter has subsided, add the pears and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Cook the pears until just warmed through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the cream cheese; stir until cream cheese is melted. Remove from skillet to stop the cooking and transfer to a bowl. Lay bread on a cutting board and make a 2-inch incision into the side to form a pocket inside the bread. Be careful not to pierce the other side of the bread. Repeat for each slice of bread. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pear mixture into each pocket and set aside. Combine egg whites, whole egg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; whisk together. Transfer egg mixture to a shallow 6-inch wide plate. Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat for 1 minute. Lightly spray the griddle with cooking spray. Take 1 stuffed French toast and lightly dip both sides into the egg mixture, and then lightly dip each edge. Place the French toast on the griddle and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes on the other side. While each piece of French toast is cooking on its first side, repeat the dipping process with the next one. Once the toast is golden brown, remove from heat. (You can keep the toast warm in a low-temperature oven while you are making the rest.) Serve with maple syrup, if desired. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound premade pizza dough 
 12 cups loosely packed torn romaine lettuce (about 2 heads) 
 Favorite Caesar dressing 
 Olive oil 
 1/2 cup Roasted Garlic Paste, recipe follows 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, plus extra for garnish 
 1 pound whole garlic heads 
 1/2 cup pure olive oil 
 Gray sea salt and freshly ground pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat a grill to high. Put the lettuce in a bowl. Pour the dressing over and toss well. Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin discs with a rolling pin. The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust. Coat the rolled out dough with olive oil and place, oiled side down, on a very hot grill. This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan that has been preheated over medium-medium high. When you start to see bubbles on the surface of the dough, turn it over. It should be slightly browned on the bottom. Brush each round with a generous tablespoon of the garlic paste and sprinkle with the thyme. Remove from the grill with tongs and top with the Caesar salad. Grate parmesan cheese on top, fold in half, and eat. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Peel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic. Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves. Save the small pieces of garlic for another use (see Chef's Note). Put the heads, cut sides up, in a small baking dish and pour the olive oil over them. Season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly, place in the oven, and roast until about 3/4 cooked, about 45 minutes. Uncover and return to the oven until the cloves begin to pop out of their skins and brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool. When cool enough to handle easily, squeeze the roasted garlic into a small bowl. Press against the skins very well to get out all the sweet roasted garlic you can. Add the oil from the baking dish and mix well until a paste forms. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Chef's Note: It is hard to have too much roasted garlic around. You can roast the little bits from the tips of the garlic heads. Put them in a separate small baking container, such as an individual custard cup. Season with salt and pepper, douse with olive oil, cover, and place in the oven to bake along with the whole garlic heads. Depending on their size, they will be soft and browned in about 1/2 the time needed for the whole heads. The little pieces make a good "cook's snack" while preparing dinner, or can be squeezed into tomato sauce or onto pasta. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 bottle red wine 
 1/2 cup eau de vie (inexpensive cognac) 
 5 cinnamon sticks; broken into pieces 
 20 whole cloves 
 1 piece ginger 
 1 teaspoon crushed cardamom seeds 
 Rind from one orange 
 1 cup sugar 
 3 drops vanilla extract 
 1 bottle red wine 
 3/4 cup vodka 
 3 cinnamon sticks 
 10 whole cloves 
 1 piece fresh ginger 
 Rind from one orange 
 1 teaspoon seeds 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 Instructions: 
 For both recipes you prepare as follows. Place all spices and vodka/cognac in a glass jar overnight. Strain the liquid. Mix wine, vodka/cognac and sugar in a saucepan. Heat very slowly until hot and the sugar has dissolved. Make sure that the brew does not boil. Serve in small cups or mugs with raisins and peeled almonds. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 medium, firm eggplant 
 1 clove garlic, cracked away from the skin 
 2 pinches ground allspice 
 Coarse salt and black pepper 
 1 handful flat-leaf parsley tops 
 A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 whole grain baguette or other long crusty bread, sliced at bread counter 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to highest setting, at least 500 degrees F. Cut 2 or 3 slits into whole eggplant. Place eggplant directly on the oven rack in the middle of the oven and roast the eggplant until it is tender, about 20 minutes. Keep the slits facing up so that the eggplant does not loose liquids as it roasts. The roasted eggplant will look like a flat tire when you remove it from the oven. Using a sharp utility knife, carefully peel skin away from eggplant flesh. Add cooked eggplant flesh and juice to food processor and combine with garlic, allspice, salt, and pepper and parsley. Pulse grind the eggplant into a paste, add a drizzle of olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish. The seeds of the eggplant will make the spread resemble caviar eggs, and so the name: poor man's caviar. To serve, surround a bowlful of spread with crusty bread rounds. Tidbit: Mixed olives and selections of Italian sheep's milk cheeses are suggested accompaniments to this menu to round out your buffet. They require no recipe or preparation and add something to the offering overall. Place them on the buffet near the eggplant caviar and bread. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons granulated garlic 
 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1 1/2 tablespoons mustard powder 
 1 tablespoon paprika 
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 
 One 6- to 7-pound bone-in prime rib 
 3 sprigs fresh oregano 
 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 
 3 sprigs fresh thyme 
 3 tablespoons canola oil 
 1/4 cup minced garlic 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary leaves 
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2 shallots, minced 
 1 stick unsalted butter 
 1 cup low-sodium beef broth 
 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 
 1 tablespoon demi-glace 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a charcoal kettle-style grill; charcoal; 8 cups large smoking wood chips (applewood and hickory mix), soaked in water; butcher's twine For the prime rib: Heat the charcoal until hot, then carefully arrange on one side of a kettle-style grill, and place the soaked wood chips over the hot coals. Place an aluminum pan filled with some water opposite to the coals to catch any drippings. Place a wire rack on the grill. Cover the grill to allow the smoke to accumulate and preheat to about 225 degrees F. In a small bowl, add the granulated garlic, black pepper, salt, mustard powder, paprika and cayenne, and mix well. Rub the spice mixture all over the prime rib, then set aside. Combine the oregano, rosemary and thyme and tie together with butcher's twine. In a large cast-iron pan set over medium-high heat, add the oil. Rub the oil all over the pan using the herb bundle, then set aside. Place the prime rib fat-side down in the pan and sear until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip over and sear the other side until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn on its end and sear for 2 minutes. Place the prime rib on the grill over the aluminum pan, with the thick end facing the coals. Place the lid on the grill. Smoke the prime rib until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F for medium-rare, 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours. Remove the prime rib to a baking sheet and set aside to rest. For the sauce: In a medium saute pan set over medium-high heat, add the garlic, parsley, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, salt, shallots and butter. Cook, stirring continuously, until the butter foams and the garlic turns a light golden color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire and demi-glace. Stir to combine, and cook until the sauce reduces by one-third, remove from the heat and set aside. If the chine bone has been removed, slice the prime rib into generous 1-bone portions. Otherwise, slice off the bone and cut into generous portions, and then place on a platter. Spoon the sauce over the top, and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 large sweet potatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch French fries 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons flour 
 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 to 3 shallots, thinly sliced 
 Pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 cups organic beef stock 
 Pinch fresh thyme leaves 
 Pinch brown sugar 
 Handful minced fresh parsley 
 Peanut oil or canola oil, for deep frying 
 2 cups cheese curds* 
 Instructions: 
 Push potatoes through a French fry cutter, or hand cut so that pieces are uniform in size. Soak in ice water for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Heat a pan on medium, melt butter. Add the flour and whisk vigorously for about 8 minutes until the roux is amber colored. Remove the pan from the heat. In another pan, saute the shallots in olive oil over medium heat for a few minutes until the edges are crisp and golden. Add the sea salt and pepper. Deglaze with organic beef stock, add thyme, brown sugar, and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the roux and let reduce on medium low for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and stir in fresh, minced parsley. Heat enough peanut oil to come half-way up the side of a heavy pot to 375 degrees F, or use a deep-fryer. Strain the chilled sweet potato fries and dry them in a salad spinner. Using a fry basket, fry the potatoes in small batches for 5 minutes, then lay them on a wire rack, set over a paper-towel lined sheet pan to drain the excess oil. Place the fries on a plate, top with the cheese curds and smother with hot gravy. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 ounces egg yolks (about 8 large egg yolks) 
 8 ounces granulated sugar 
 8 ounces mango chutney, divided 
 4 ounces mango nectar 
 6 to 8 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks 
 1 ripe Alphonso or Champagne mango, peeled and chopped finely 
 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 3 teaspoons baking powder 
 3 teaspoons coriander powder 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 cup brown sugar 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 3 whole large eggs plus 1 egg white 
 1/2 cup milk 
 1/3 cup mango juice concentrate 
 1/3 cup mango nectar 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 Sweetened Condensed Milk Whipped Cream, recipe follows 
 Dried Mango Star Garnish, recipe follows 
 4 cups heavy cream, cold 
 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
 Pinch salt 
 1 package sweetened dried mango 
 Instructions: 
 For the mango chutney curd: Put a small pot filled with 1-inch of water on the stovetop to boil. In a medium stainless steel bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until combined. Add 4 ounces of the mango chutney and the mango nectar. Whisk until combined. Place the bowl on top of the pot of boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Whisk continuously until the mixture reduces and thickens to the consistency of sour cream, 10 to 20 minutes. Take the mixture off the stove. Add the butter and whisk until the butter is fully incorporated. Fold in remaining 4 ounces mango chutney and the mango chunks into the curd and allow to cool before filling the cupcakes. For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line tins with 24 muffin cups. In a small saucepan, heat the butter on low until just melted. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, coriander and salt. Add the sugars and whisk until all the dry ingredients are combined. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and egg white until lightly beaten. Mix in the milk, mango juice concentrate, mango nectar and vanilla. Gradually add the wet ingredients into the dry, whisking until just combined. Scoop 1/2 cup batter into the saucepan of melted butter. Stir until combined. Add the oil and continue to mix until all are incorporated. Pour back into the large bowl of batter. Fold in until incorporated. Use a 1 1/2-ounce portion scoop to scoop the batter into each muffin cup, filling 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the cake, 18 to 22 minutes. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove to a cooling rack until completely cool. Hollow out 1/2-inch of the center of the cupcake with a corer or paring knife. Fill with the mango chutney curd. Top with a dollop of Sweetened Condensed Milk Whipped Cream and a Dried Mango Star Garnish. A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe and therefore, we cannot make representation as to the results. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly pour in the condensed milk. Add the salt. Mix until firm peaks form. Do not over-mix. Use a small rolling pin to flatten a few pieces of dried mango. Cut out 24 stars with 1/2-inch star shaped cookie cutter. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds fresh sardine fillets, (from about 4 pounds whole sardines) ***you can also use 
 salmon fillets 
 Salt 
 Freshly ground white pepper 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 8 leaves sage 
 6 sprigs thyme 
 4 sprigs rosemary 
 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 
 3 pounds eggplant, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices (on the 
 bias) 
 40 pieces Tomato Confit, recipe follows 
 12 ounces piquillo or roasted red bell peppers 
 Instructions: 
 Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the sardines or salmon in a single layer on the pan. Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper and one quarter of the olive oil. Scatter half the sage, thyme, rosemary, and garlic over the fillets and slide the pan into the oven. Roast the sardines for 7 minutes, or until they're just cooked through. Remove the sardines from the baking pan, cool, and then chill in the refrigerator. Re-line the baking sheet with clean parchment paper and arrange the eggplant on the sheet. Season the eggplant slices with salt and pepper as well as the remaining oil and herbs. Bake the eggplant for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Cool and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill. Line an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing it to extend over the sides. The terrine will be built with the eggplant, peppers, sardines, and tomatoes in layers, starting with the eggplant. To begin, cut the eggplant slices to fit the terrine and lay a layer of eggplant over the bottom and up the sides of the terrine, allow the slices to overlap a little and overhang the edges. Top with peppers, then sardines, then tomatoes. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing by folding the overhanging eggplant over the top of the terrine and leveling the top with an additional layer of eggplant slices. Cover the top with the plastic wrap that's hanging over the sides and press another piece of plastic wrap against the top for good measure. Cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to fit inside the top of the terrine and press it down firmly against the plastic wrap. Place a weight, such as a 1-pound can, on top of the cardboard, put the terrine on a parchment-lined tray (to catch any drips that result from the weighting), and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or overnight. To serve: If you have an electric knife, now's the time to use it, if not, choose a long thin serrated knife and work with a sawing motion. Remove the weight, the cardboard, and the sheet of plastic wrap. Carefully cut the loaf into slices, each no less than 1-inch thick (thinner slices will fall apart.) If you'd like, serve the terrine with a small green salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 12 "very thin" slices of sandwich bread or jicama 
 4 tablespoons melted butter 
 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 12 thin slices smoked salmon 
 1 tablespoon finely snipped dill leaves 
 1 tablespoon chive "batons" (chives cut into 2-inch lengths) 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With a biscuit cutter or heart shaped cutter, cut out heart shapes (can be done in advance). Brush melted butter on both sides of the bread and set them on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until toasts are golden brown; remove and set aside until later. (Or, for low cal alternative, cut wide thin slices of jicama, then cut out heart shapes from those - can be done in advance, and kept in dampened cloth in the refrigerator.) Combine olive oil and lime juice and season lightly with salt and pepper. Set two "heart" shaped toast points or jicama slices in middle of a dinner plate. Heart points should meet in center and overlap each other slightly. Roll up or drape a slice of smoked salmon in the middle of each heart and brush with olive oil and rice vinegar dressing. For a professional looking presentation, scatter dill and chives over everything; including the plate. At last minute, coarsely grind fresh pepper over the top. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Kosher salt 
 12 ounces mezzi rigatoni (or other short pasta) 
 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
 1 bunch leeks (white and light green parts only), halved lengthwise, thinly sliced and rinsed well 
 Freshly ground pepper 
 3/4 cup heavy cream 
 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 
 Chopped fresh parsley, for topping 
 Instructions: 
 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water; drain the pasta. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the skillet. Add the leeks to the drippings in the skillet. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the heavy cream and cook until it begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the pasta to the skillet along with the parmesan, half of the bacon and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat, adding enough of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen. To serve, top with the remaining bacon, more parmesan and parsley. Photograph by Justin Walker <|endoftext|>

 Watch how to make this recipe. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, zest, garlic and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the fish in a baking dish and pour the marinade on top. Marinate for no more than 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler or grill. Lightly coat a baking sheet with olive oil. Remove the fish from the marinade and arrange on the baking sheet, making sure to leave space between the pieces. Broil until just cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium saute pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Fry the corn tortillas, 1 at a time, just until crisp, flipping halfway through to brown both sides. Drain on paper towels and salt while still hot. To assemble the tostadas: Layer each tostada first with Sauteed White Beans, then the fish. Top with the shredded cabbage and Pineapple and Avocado Salsa. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and a squeeze of a lime wedge. In a small pan, over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot add the onion with a pinch of salt and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Raise the heat and add the white wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half. Stir in the beans and oregano and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook gently for 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve. In a medium bowl, make the dressing by mixing 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice with the lime juice, honey, oil and jalapeno. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the pineapple and onion. Gently fold in the avocado and cilantro. Let the flavors blend for at least 15 minutes before serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 chicken breasts with bone 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 celery stalks, sliced 
 2 onions, 1 diced, 1 sliced 
 1 large carrot, diced 
 2 cups chicken stock or chicken bouillon 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 4 English muffins, cut in half 
 1 cup pine nuts 
 Salt and pepper 
 2 medium summer or crookneck squash, cut in rounds 
 2 medium zucchini, cut in rounds 
 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 
 Instructions: 
 Wash and pat dry chicken breasts, season with salt and pepper and sear in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Remove from pan and set aside. Drain the oil from pan. Using the same frying pan add 1 tablespoon olive oil and saute celery, diced onion and carrot. Cook through allowing the flavors to meld. Return the seared chicken breasts to the pan and add the chicken stock and the white wine. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cover. Simmer until the chicken breasts are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid and reduce the liquid until it is not so brothy. Season with salt and pepper. While the chicken is cooking, toast the English muffins and set aside. Toast the pine nuts in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt. Saute the remaining sliced onion, squash and zucchini, allowing for some browning. Stir gently while seasoning with salt, pepper and oregano. Continue cooking until squash is slightly browned and the onion is translucent. Remove the chicken breasts from the pan and place on the individual dinner plates. Take the toasted English muffins and soak up some of the pan juices. Using the chicken breast as a "lean to", place it so it faces the front of the plate. Add the sauteed zucchini mixture to the plate and cover the breast and the muffin with the vegetable mirepoix. Garnish with toasted pine nuts. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Pasta Frolla 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/3 cup sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 stick unsalted butter 
 2 large eggs 
 Cooked Wheat Kernels 
 1/2 cup hulled wheat kernels 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 tablespoon butter 
 Pastry Cream 
 3 tablespoons sugar 
 2 tablespoons flour 
 1/2 cup milk 
 1 egg 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Ricotta Filling 
 1 cup (1/2 pound) whole milk ricotta 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon orange flower water 
 1/2 cup diced candied orange peel 
 Cinnamon 
 Egg wash: One egg well beaten with a pinch of salt 
 Instructions: 
 For the Pasta Frolla, combine dry ingredients in food processor and pulse to mix. Cut butter into 8 pieces and add. Pulse to mix in finely. Add eggs and pulse until dough forms a ball. Remove from work bowl, wrap and chill dough. Soak the wheat in water to cover overnight if possible. Drain the wheat and place in a pan with salt and water to cover by 3 to 4 inches and simmer until tender, about 2 hours. Add water as necessary to keep from drying out and sticking. Cool and refrigerate until needed. For the pastry cream, combine sugar and flour in a small, non-reactive saucepan. Stir well to mix and add the milk, slowly, whisking it in smoothly. Whisk in the egg. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the pastry cream thickens and comes to a boil. Boil, stirring vigorously, about 1/2 minute. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and scrape into a clean bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface and chill. For the filling, place ricotta in a mixing bowl and stir the cooled pastry cream to make a smooth, creamy mixture; stir in the sugar, eggs and remaining ingredients. Stir in the cooked wheat kernels. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. Butter a 9-inch cake pan, 2-inches deep. To assemble, cut off 1/3 of the Pasta Frolla and reserve it. Roll the 2/3 of the dough into a 14-inch disk and line the prepared pan with it. Allow the dough to hang over the edge of the pan. Pour in the filling and sprinkle it with the cinnamon. Roll the remaining 1/3 of the dough into a 10-inch square. Cut it into 10 1-inch wide strips. Paint the strips with the egg wash. Moisten the rim of the dough on the pan with the egg wash, and adhere 5 strips in each direction, forming a diagonal lattice. Trim away any excess dough even with the top of the pan and push the dough all around off the top rim of the pan so that it is completely within the pan. Bake about 45 minutes, until the filling is set and the pastry is light golden. Cool in the pan before unmolding. To unmold, invert onto a flat plate, lift off the pan, replace the pan with another plate or platter, then re-invert, so that the Pastiera is right side up. Serve the Pastiera at room temperature. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 
 10 ounces (2 1/2 sticks) soft butter or (half butter/half shortening) 
 3 large eggs 
 5 1/3 cups all purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
 Instructions: 
 Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and continue to cream. Add salt and vanilla. Add flour all at once and blend just until flour has dissolved. Refrigerate until ready to use. This dough must be used CHILLED. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 cups balsamic vinegar 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 1 pound parsnips, peeled and chopped into even pieces 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 Salt and pepper 
 1 1/2 pounds large scallops (preferably U-8 or U-10) 
 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 5 ounces baby carrots, halved lengthways 
 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter 
 4 sprigs fresh thyme 
 2 cups micro arugula or baby arugula 
 Lemon juice, for garnish 
 Truffle oil, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 For the balsamic reduction: Combine the balsamic vinegar and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by three-quarters of its original volume. Set aside to cool. For the parsnip puree: place the parsnips in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add enough heavy cream to cover and bring to a slow boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the parsnips are cooked. Place in a blender and process until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Next, carefully remove the connective tissue found on the side of each scallop, if applicable. Pat dry with a paper towel and season both sides with salt and pepper. In a small saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat to smoke point, then place half of the dry, seasoned scallops in the pan, being careful to not splash the oil. When the scallops are golden brown and have released from the pan, turn over and sear on the opposite side. Add half of the carrots, half of the butter and half of the thyme to the pan. When the butter begins to foam, lower the heat and carefully angle the pan so the butter is to one side, and baste the scallops while they finish cooking. Repeat the process with the rest of the scallops in a new pan or quickly rinse the previous pan. In a bowl, mix the arugula with a touch of lemon juice, truffle oil and salt. Serve the scallops on a warm plate over the parsnip puree. Garnish the plate with baby carrots, truffled arugula and the balsamic reduction. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (6 ounce) fillet sushi-grade yellowfin tuna 
 1 cup Asian marinade, store-bought 
 1/2 cup olive oil, plus 1/2 cup, plus 1 tablespoon 
 1 cup julienne vegetables (carrot, zucchini, squash) 
 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds 
 1 bunch chives 
 1 cup white rice, cooked 
 1 tablespoon scallions, thinly sliced 
 Instructions: 
 Coat the tuna with the marinade and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the olive oil to a medium saute pan and turn on medium-high heat. Julienne all of the vegetables and saute them quickly, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. When the tuna is ready, take it out of the marinade and coat with the black sesame seeds. Pour another 1/2 cup of olive oil into a medium saute pan. Place on medium-high heat and sear tuna on both sides until golden brown. Let the tuna cool for 5 minutes. In a blender, blend the chives and remaining oil and strain. Place the strained mixture into the refrigerator until needed. To serve, mold the rice in a ramkin and place in center of the plate. Place the vegetables on top. Next, slice the tuna into 1-inch thick slices. Place them around the rice, making sure to overlap them just a bit. Spoon the chive oil around the plate and garnish with scallions. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup shredded cucumber, seeds discarded 
 2 cups plain Greek yogurt (see Cook's Notes) 
 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 6 sprigs fresh dill, chopped 
 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Salt and pepper, optional 
 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, 15 to 25-percent fat (the fattier, the tastier) 
 1 medium red onion, finely chopped 
 35 fresh mint leaves, chopped 
 1/2 pound manouri cheese, crumbled, or feta cheese 
 2 long baguettes, each one cut into 3 equal pieces, sliced open 
 1 to 3 tomatoes, depending on type or size, sliced 
 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced 
 Salt and pepper 
 Spanish smoked paprika, optional 
 Instructions: 
 For the tzatziki: Place the cucumber into a strainer or colander over a bowl and squeeze with your hands the shredded cucumber to release the liquid. When the liquid comes to a slow drip, set the strainer into a bowl and set the bowl in the refrigerator to continue to slowly drip for 30 minutes. Make sure the bottom of the strainer does not touch the bowl. (The purpose of straining the cucumber is important to retain the thick consistency of tzatziki sauce. You can either discard the cucumber liquid or reserve it to make a refreshing cucumber water drink.) Empty the yogurt into a medium bowl. Add the strained cucumber along with the garlic, dill, vinegar and oil into the bowl and gently mix with a whisk. When all the ingredients are equally distributed, your tzatziki sauce is ready. Season with salt and pepper, if using. (Sauce can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.) For the bifteki: In a medium bowl, add the ground beef, red onion and mint leaves. With your hands, work in all the ingredients until everything is equally distributed. Then add the crumbled cheese and mix, being careful not to overwork the mixture. You want the cheese to stay relatively chunky. Form into a loaf and cut into 6 equal pieces, about 5 ounces each. Form each piece into an oval-shaped meatball and then pat down to form an oval shaped patty. (Patties can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.) For the sandwich: Cook each patty on a hot charcoal grill or broiler for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until desired temperature is reached. (I like this patty cooked to medium, unlike my burgers that I prefer on the rare side.) Lightly toast the baguettes on the grill, if desired. Remove from the heat and then spread 1 tablespoon of tzatziki sauce on the top half of each baguette piece. When the patties are ready, remove from the heat and cut on a bias into 3 equal parts. Spread the cut pieces over the bottom half of the toasted baguette. Top the patty with sliced tomatoes and sliced red onions. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and Spanish smoked paprika, if using. Press both sides of the baguette together and enjoy. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 One 12-inch loaf Italian bread 
 4 cloves garlic, peeled 
 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature 
 1/4 cup freshly chopped basil leaves 
 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 
 1/4 cup grated mozzarella 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the bread in half, lengthwise. Add the garlic, herbs, butter, and Parmesan to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until well incorporated. Alternatively, you could fold the ingredients together using a rubber spatula. Spread the butter mixture down the inner length of both slices of the bread. Wrap the pieces in aluminum foil and put them onto a sheet tray. Bake until the bread crisps up and the cheese melts, about 10 minutes. At this point, remove the foil, sprinkle the slices with the mozzarella cheese and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Slide the bread back into oven until the cheese bubbles, about 5 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven to a cutting board and slice before serving. <|endoftext|>

Bake for 45 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 slices bacon (about 8 ounces), cut into 1/2 inch pieces 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 18 large eggs 
 1/2 cup half-and-half 
 3 scallions, thinly sliced 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced 
 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar 
 16 potato sandwich rolls, split 
 Hot sauce, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the bacon pieces in a single layer on an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan and drizzle with vegetable oil. Bake until crisp and lightly browned, about 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove the pan from the oven but do not drain the fat or remove the bacon. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, half-and-half, scallions, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl. Redistribute the bacon evenly on the sheet pan, then pour the egg mixture over and top with tomatoes and cheese. Return the pan to the oven, being careful not to spill, and bake until the eggs are just set, about 25 minutes. Let the eggs cool 5 minutes before cutting. Meanwhile, warm the buns in the oven on a separate baking sheet. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the eggs into 16 even portions and place them between the bun halves. Serve the sandwiches with hot sauce on the side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3/4 pound ground sirloin 
 3/4 pound ground chuck 
 1/2 pound raw chorizo, casings removed and crumbled 
 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning 
 1 large onion, grated 
 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 large yellow onions, finely sliced 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1/2 cup bottled and sliced jalapeno chiles, drained 
 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 
 2 medium jarred roasted red bell peppers, drained 
 3/4 cup mayonnaise 
 6 slices Oaxaca cheese or mozzarella 
 6 hamburger rolls 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a large bowl, mix thoroughly by hand the ground beef, the chorizo, the adobo seasoning, the grated onion and the bread crumbs. Form the burgers into 6 patties without pressing them too much or they can become tough. Line a baking pan with waxed paper and put the burgers side-by-side in a single layer. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This will help the burgers hold together. If you make more than you need just separate with waxed paper and insert into a storage freezer bag for future use.; Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Add the jalapeno chiles and the brown sugar. Saute for 15 minutes or until the onion and the chiles are caramelized and soft. Set aside.; Drain the roasted red peppers and put them in a blender or food processor. Add the mayonnaise, and season with salt and pepper. Puree the mayonnaise and roasted red peppers until well combined and the mixture is smooth. NOTE: This may be done up to 2 days ahead of time, and in fact the flavor will be more complete with an overnight chilling.; Preheat an outdoor grill or grill pan on the stove top over medium-high heat. Place the burgers on the hot grill or pan until cooked to desired doneness. Due to the raw chorizo in the recipe, at least medium-well is recommended, approximately 10 minutes on each side. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, top the burgers with the slices of cheese so it can melt. If your grill has a lid, putting it on briefly will help the cheese melt quickly and evenly. To serve: Spread about 1 tablespoon of the red pepper mayonnaise on both sides of the rolls. Lay a burger on the bottom halves, and top with a couple of spoonfuls of the caramelized onion and jalapeno relish. <|endoftext|>

 1/3 cup sugar 
 2/3 cup/150 ml heavy cream 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Prepare the rhubarb by putting it in a saucepan with the sugar and 1/4-cup/60 ml water. Bring to a simmer and cook until soft. If it seems too runny, simply leave on the heat, stirring, to let some of the liquid evaporate. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Beat the egg white to stiff peaks with the pinch of salt. Heat the sugar with 3 tablespoons of water to thread stage. Cook's Note: Which is just before it starts to color. With the beaters going, pour the sugar-water mixture into the beaten egg whites and continue beating until the stiff meringue is cooled. Meanwhile, beat the cream to peaks with the vanilla extract. Fold the two mixtures together. Spoon the rhubarb in the bottoms of 4 coupes. Top with parfait. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 Ingredients: 
 Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 
 2 pounds large boiling or baking potatoes, scrubbed 
 Fine salt 
 Instructions: 
 Heat about 2-inches of oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer reads 365 degrees F. Line a pan with paper towels. While the oil heats slice the potatoes into shoestring fries with the thin julienne attachment of a hand-held mandolin or vegetable slicer. Swish the cut potatoes in a bowl of tepid water, and then spin them as dry as possible in a salad spinner. Spread them on towels, and blot with more towels—you want the potatoes bone dry so that they don't spatter in the hot oil. Increase the heat to medium-high, and working in batches, carefully add the potatoes to the oil and fry until brown and crispy, about 4 minutes. Scoop the fries from the oil with a slotted spoon, and drain on the prepared pan. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes, making sure the oil returns to 365 degrees F. before adding each batch. Season with salt and serve. Copyright 2005 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon chipotle in adobo (including some liquid) 
 1/4 cup orange juice 
 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses 
 1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds 
 2 tablespoons brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
 Pinch cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 
 1 teaspoon orange zest 
 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 
 1 boneless pork loin roast, about 3 pounds (wrapped and tied with some fat left on) 
 2 cloves garlic, slivered 
 Fresh thyme sprigs, plus extra, for garnish 
 Kosher salt 
 Black pepper 
 Ground cumin 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Up to 1 cup dry white wine 
 1 onion, thinly sliced 
 1/2 cup chopped, dried mission figs 
 1 orange, segmented 
 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 
 Watercress sprigs, for garnish 
 Orange peel curls, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 To Make the Sauce: Mix the chipotle chile and orange juice in a mini-food processor until pureed. Add the next 9 marinade ingredients, pulsing to combine. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut small slits in the roast, cutting with the grain and insert garlic slivers and an equal number of thyme sprigs. Rub the roast liberally with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed roasting pan, combine butter and olive oil. When bubbling, add the roast to the pan and turn to brown on all sides (about 8 minutes). Add 1/2 cup wine and the onion to the pan and place in the oven. After 20 minutes, start basting the roast with the sauce. Continue to baste until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, about 1 hour total. Transfer the roast to a carving board, tent with foil and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, spoon off any excess fat from the pan then deglaze with 1/4 cup wine; when bubbling add chopped figs, orange segments, and 1 teaspoon fresh minced thyme. Simmer gently for about 10 minutes, until the figs are soft. Remove from the heat and puree using an immersion blender. There should be some chunks remaining in the "marmalade". To Serve: Remove twine and slice pork 1/2-inch thick. Top slices with a generous spoonful of the marmalade and garnish with thyme sprigs, or for a buffet, present the whole roast on a nest of watercress (or arugula) and orange peel curls. Add the marmalade to each serving as your carve. Cook's Note: It is very important that there is a thin layer of fat on the roast and that it is all natural?not water and nitrate "plumped". <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups medium-grain white rice (such as Calrose) 
 2 1/2 cups cold water 
 1 (4-inch-square) piece dried kelp (konbu),* wiped lightly with dry cloth 
 1/4 cup rice vinegar 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
 1 tablespoon chipotle pepper puree 
 1 tablespoon honey 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 4 (8 1/4 by 7 1/4-inch) sheets roasted nori 
 Sushi rice 
 1 cup white sesame seeds 
 1/2 Kirby cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/16-inch-thick matchsticks 
 1 1/4 pounds fresh tuna, finely diced 
 1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves 
 3 scallions, thinly sliced 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Place the rice in strainer. Rinse under cold water until water runs clear. Drain well. Transfer rice to heavy medium saucepan. Add 1 1/4 cups fresh cold water and kelp to pan. Cover and let soak 30 minutes. Uncover, discard kelp and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until water is absorbed and rice is just tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand covered 15 minutes. Transfer rice to large glass bowl. Combine vinegar, sugar and salt in small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Drizzle mixture over rice. Gently toss rice with vinegar mixture to coat. Cover rice with clean damp towel and cool completely at room temperature (do not refrigerate). Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, chipotle, honey and oil; season with salt and pepper. Place sushi mat on a work surface with slats running crosswise. Arrange 1 sheet nori, shiny side down, on mat, lining up a long edge of sheet with edge of mat nearest you. Using damp fingers, gently press 1/4 of rice onto nori in 1 layer, leaving a 1 3/4-inch border on side farthest from you. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Flip the nori and rice over so that the nori is now the top layer. Make a thin line of cucumber along the nori 1 to 2 inches from the edge closest to you. Drizzle some of the spicy mayonnaise mixture over the cucumbers, then spoon on the tuna and sprinkle with cilantro and scallions. Roll tightly, using the sushi mat to guide you. Slice about 1/1/2 inches thick. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make a total of 4 rolls. <|endoftext|>

 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1 pound thinly slice prosciutto di Parma, (approximately) 
 1 pound all-purpose flour, for dredging 
 10 eggs, beaten, for egg wash 
 1 1/2 pounds fine bread crumbs 
 2 cups oil (approximately), for frying 
 Instructions: 
 Combine basil, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a food processor and process until smooth. Bring 5 quarts of water to a simmer and remove from heat. In a large mixing bowl, break apart the curd into small pieces (it is best to use your hands). Season the curd with kosher salt. Carefully pour the hot water over the curd. Using 2 long wooden spoons, carefully but quickly begin working the curd, forming it into a smooth, lumpless ball. Once curd is of smooth texture, remove from water and place onto a plastic film lined sheet pan. Evenly stretch the mozzarella on the sheet pan to cover the entire surface. Spread a thin layer of the basil puree on the mozzarella. Place a thin layer of the prosciutto di Parma over the basil puree. Using the underlying film, begin rolling the mozzarella tightly, forming a pinwheel. Wrap the entire log of mozzarella in plastic wrap and place into refrigerator. Allow to rest for 8 to 24 hours. Slice the mozzarella log into 1-inch pieces. Dredge in flour, then in egg wash and then lightly coat with bread crumbs. Reserve in refrigerator until time to pan fry. Pan fry in oil until golden brown on both sides. <|endoftext|>

Heat the vinegar in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until steam rises from the liquid. Place the saucepan on a heat diffuser and let the liquid reduce very slowly (it shouldn't simmer) for 2 to 3 hours, until it has reduced and thickened to a syrupy glaze. There should be approximately 1 cup of glaze. Keep the glaze in a squeeze bottle at room temperature for garnishing: if the glaze is too thick, warm the bottle in hot water to loosen the glaze. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 One 16-oz package kataifi (shredded phyllo dough) 
 1 cup raw, unsalted pistachios 
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
 3 pounds ricotta cheese 
 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 
 1/5 cup (about 3 1/4 tablespoons) confectioner's sugar 
 2 tablespoons vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup egg whites 
 1 cup Citrus Syrup, warmed, recipe follows 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 1/2 lemon, zested 
 1/2 orange, zested 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a 10 1/2-inch springform pan Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom of the springform pan with a layer of the kataifi. Bake until golden brown, 10 minutes. Then cool completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Place the pistachios, cinnamon and cloves in a food processor and process until the nuts are chunky and uniform in size. Do not over process. Reserve half of the nuts for a later use. Sprinkle the first half of the nuts over the baked pastry; spread most of the nuts towards the edges of the pan and fade to a light coating in the center of the pan. This will create a nice crust on the back of each piece when the dessert is cut and served. In a large mixing bowl mix together the ricotta, cream, sugar and vanilla with a large spoon. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or by hand with a whisk, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture with a spatula or rubber scraper. Pour the mixture into the pan over the nuts. Sprinkle the remaining nuts on top of the ricotta mixture similar to the first time, with most of the nuts on the outer edge and fade to lightly coat the center. Spread the remaining sheet of kataifi on top of the cake, covering the entire surface. Bake until golden brown and the cake is set, 1 hour 30 minutes. Cool the cake completely. Pour the hot Citrus Syrup over the cooled cake, then cut and serve. Place the sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and orange zest in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the mixture achieves a syrup consistency, 20 minutes. <|endoftext|>

Pour the cornbread into a bowl and spoon in some of the broth mixture. Keep adding broth, tossing as you go, until it's all mixed in. Season with salt and pepper, add the bacon and toss again. If you like your dressing extra moist, add a little more broth. Pile the dressing into a 3-quart casserole pan and bake, uncovered, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve piping hot. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Add the cornmeal to a large bowl along with the flour, baking powder, salt, basil, sage and thyme and stir together. Measure the buttermilk in a measuring cup, add the whole milk and egg and stir together with a fork. Add the baking soda and stir. Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a fork until just combined. Do not overmix. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons shortening in the microwave and slowly add to the batter, stirring constantly until combined. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and shortening. Pour the batter into the hot skillet, spread to even out the surface and cook over high heat for 1 minute. Then get it into the oven straightaway and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. The edges should be crispy. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds fingerling potatoes, par-cooked in salted water, drained and thinly sliced 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus 1/4 cup fronds for serving 
 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, plus more for serving 
 2 to 3 tablespoons canola oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 
 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish 
 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 
 1 to 2 teaspoons honey 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 Smoked Trout, recipe follows 
 1 large bunch watercress, woody stems removed 
 1/2 cup kosher salt 
 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 
 8 trout fillets, skin on 
 Special equipment: Alder wood or applewood chips, soaked in cold water for at least 2 hours 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the grill for direct grilling, high heat. Toss the potatoes with the canola oil, 2 tablespoons chopped dill, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer to a grill basket and grill, tossing occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Combine the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, horseradish, mustard, honey, and salt and pepper to taste, and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Drizzle some of the dressing over the bottom of a large serving platter or shallow bowl. Pour the warm potatoes on top. Scatter the Smoked Trout over the potatoes, then the watercress and dill fronds. Dust with more smoked paprika and drizzle a generous amount of dressing over all. Combine the salt, sugar and 4 cups water in a 4-quart container and stir until the salt has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the trout, making sure they are submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Remove the trout from the brine, rinse thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Place the trout skin-side down onto a rack set in a half sheet pan. Dry in the refrigerator until the skin becomes shiny and somewhat tacky to the touch, 21 to 24 hours. Prepare the smoker using the alder or applewood chips so that it maintains a temperature of 150 to 160 degrees F. Place the trout onto the smoking racks, skin-side down, separating them by at least 1/4-inch and place into the smoker. Adjust the heat as needed and cook until the fish has cooked through, darkened in color around the edges and has the desired level of smoke flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove from the smoker and cool. Remove the flesh from the skin and gently break into big chunks. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 
 3/4 teaspoon double-acting baking powder 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 2 cups sugar 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
 2 large eggs 
 1 cup sour cream 
 1 tablespoon vanilla 
 2/3 cup water 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 pound milk chocolate, broken into pieces 
 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 
 1 cup strawberry jam 
 Assorted candy and nuts for decoration, such as thick and thin licorice for the track, nonpareils for the wheels. Candy covered chocolate, chocolate cigarettes, candy-coated licorice, jujubes, and silvered almonds for the cargo. 
 Vanilla ice cream, as a accompaniment 
 Instructions: 
 Butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch cake pan. Line the bottom with wax or parchment paper, butter the paper, and dust the pans with flour, shaking out the excess. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Into a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand held mixer beat together the sugar, butter, and the peanut butter until the mixture is light, creamy and combined well, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the sour cream, vanilla, and the water. Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Transfer batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Rap the pan three times on a hard surface to expel any air bubbles. Place the cake in the middle rack of oven, bake for 20 minutes, rotate the pan, and continue to bake another 20 minutes or until a tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edges of the pans, invert the cake onto the rack, discard the paper, and let it cool completely. The cake may be made one day in advance and wrapped well. Make the frosting: In a heavy bottom pan slowly heat the heavy cream. When the cream just comes to a boil pour it onto the chopped chocolate. Add the corn syrup and mix well with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Let mixture cool for about an hour or until it is firm enough to spread. Assemble the "train": Trim the edges off of the cooled cake to make a perfect rectangle about 12 inches long. Slice the cake in half horizontally into 2 layers. Spread the jam on the bottom layer and place the remaining layer back on top of the jam. Cut the cake directly down the middle into halves and cut again into quarters. At this point, there should be 4 equal pieces of cake. Continue to take each quarter of the cake and cut into 3 equal rectangles. You should end up with 12 -2 inch wide pieces of cake. Take 1 piece of the cake and set aside. Frost each piece of the remaining pieces with the frosting. Take the reserved piece and cut it in half. Arrange it on top of one of the other pieces to form an engine car. Once the cake is frosted, arrange them like a train on a licorice "track" and decorate them with the candy and nuts. Serve the cake with ice cream. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 Ingredients: 
 8 thick-cut slices country bread 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Bechamel, recipe follows 
 16 slices shaved serrano ham 
 8 eggs 
 1/2 stick unsalted butter 
 3 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 2 cups whole milk 
 1/8 teaspoon grated whole nutmeg 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay bread out on a sheet tray and drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toast lightly. Spoon a dollop of bechamel onto each toast. Arrange 2 slices of ham on each slice of toast and nestle it into a nest shape so the egg will rest in the center. Crack egg and drop into nest on each toast. Bake in oven until eggs are just cooked but the yolk is still slightly runny, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Make the bechamel sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and stir constantly to incorporate - you do not want any color. Gradually pour in the milk as you stir, and whisk out any lumps. As the mixture thickens up continue to stir until it reaches a boil - this ensures that the flour is cooked completely. Using a microplane or a fine grater, grate nutmeg into bechamel and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup water 
 1 1/2 cups sugar 
 1-inch piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced 
 2 cinnamon sticks 
 3 whole cloves 
 1 cup boiling water 
 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder 
 3 to 4 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur (recommended: Frangelico), optional 
 4 ounces (1/2 cup) Kahlua 
 Instructions: 
 For the syrup: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the water, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the syrup to cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard the ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. For the espresso: In an 8-ounce glass measuring cup, whisk together the boiling water, espresso powder, and liqueur, if using, until the powder is dissolved. Set aside to cool. Combine 1 cup syrup with the espresso/hazelnut liqueur mixture in a large martini shaker. Add the Kaluha and shake to combine. Pour over ice-filled glasses and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (4-pound) pork loin 
 2 limes 
 2 lemons 
 5 to 6 garlic cloves 
 1/2 cup Irvine Spices Roasted Garlic Pepper Seasoning, as needed for rub 
 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 2 large ripe fresh peaches, peeled, pit removed and sliced, or 1 cup drained canned peaches 
 1/2 cup mayonnaise 
 2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped, plus 12 small sprigs for garnish 
 Salt and freshly ground white pepper 
 12 Kaiser rolls, or crispy crusted round rolls 
 Instructions: 
 Early in the day prepare the pork loin and marinade. Rinse pork loin to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling. Remove pork to a nonreactive container. Place the limes and lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set them aside briefly, until they cool just enough to handle. Blend the garlic cloves and the garlic pepper seasoning in a blender, then while the blender is still running, squeeze the juice of the limes and lemons through the feed tube to make a paste. With the blender still running, add the oil in a thin stream. Rub the paste into the pork, cover and leave refrigerated for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Roast covered in oven until fork tender, at least 45 minutes. Transfer pork to a utility platter and let rest in a warm place before slicing. The pork can also be cooked on the grill. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Wrap pork in a foil pouch in which you have shaken 1 tablespoon flour, and cook over indirect heat (on the side of the grill opposite the direct heat source) for about 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. Let pork rest before slicing. While the pork is cooking, prepare the aioli. Add peaches, mayonnaise, and cilantro to a food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Lay slices of pork loin on rolls and spoon peach aioli over. Garnish with cilantro sprigs. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup whole milk 
 3 tablespoons sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon instant espresso powder 
 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips 
 3 large egg whites 
 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, room temperature 
 2 tablespoons fresh squeezed orange juice 
 1/2 cup whipping cream 
 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 
 1 teaspoon orange zest 
 Instructions: 
 For the Mousse: In a small saucepan over medium heat stir together the milk with the sugar and the espresso powder until the milk is hot, but not boiling, and the sugar is dissolved. Place the chocolate chips in a blender. *Pour the hot milk over the chips. Run the blender on high until combined, a few seconds. Add the egg whites and run the blender on high until light, about 1 minute. Transfer the mousse to 4 small serving cups. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 3 hours. For the Cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, stir together the mascarpone cheese and the orange juice until smooth. Add the cream, powdered sugar, and orange zest. Whip until the cream has soft peaks, about 1 minute. Whip the cream just before serving the mousse or cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until ready to serve. * When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups sugar 
 1 cup whole milk 
 2 (5-oz) cans evaporated milk 
 5 large eggs 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1 (15-ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin 
 2 tablespoons premium golden agave tequila or bourbon 
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 Pumpkin seed praline, recipe follows 
 1 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup water 
 1 cup hulled (green) pumpkin seeds, toasted 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a 2-quart souffle dish or round ceramic casserole in middle of oven. Cook 1 cup sugar in a dry 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork, until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden, about 5 minutes. Quickly and carefully remove hot dish from oven and immediately pour caramel into dish, tilting it to cover bottom and sides. (Leave oven on.) Keep tilting as caramel cools and thickens enough to stay in place. Scald whole milk with evaporated milk in a saucepan and remove from heat. Beat eggs and remaining cup sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in salt, pumpkin, tequila, and spices. Pour milk mixture through a sieve into a bowl and beat into pumpkin mixture in a slow stream until combined well. Pour custard over caramel in dish and set in a water bath of 1-inch hot water. Put pan in middle of oven and lower temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until golden brown on top and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours, possibly longer. Remove dish from water bath and transfer to a rack to cool. Chill flan, covered, until cold, at least 6 hours. To unmold flan, dip bottom of souffle dish briefly (20 to 30 seconds) in a warm water bath. Then, run a thin knife around flan to loosen from sides of dish. Wiggle dish from side to side and, when flan moves freely in dish, invert a large serving platter with a lip over dish. Holding dish and platter securely together, quickly invert and turn out flan onto platter. Caramel will pour out over and around it. Cut flan into wedges and serve with caramel spooned over and with shards of praline. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Lightly oil a large sheet of foil on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Cook sugar, water, and a pinch of salt in a deep 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a metal fork, until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Immediately stir in pumpkin seeds and quickly pour onto foil, spreading into a thin sheet before it hardens. (If caramel hardens and is difficult to spread, put in a 400 degree F oven until warm enough to spread, 1 to 2 minutes.) Cool praline on baking sheet on a rack until completely hardened, then break into large pieces. Yield: 8 to 10 servings <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 6 sticks string cheese 
 12 pretzel sticks 
 6 long or 12 short thin chives 
 1 to 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard 
 Instructions: 
 Cut each piece of string cheese in half so you have 2 shorter sticks. Working one at a time, make 4 cuts vertically in one end of the cheese sticks, stopping about 3/4 inch from the top. Roll the cheese so the cuts are not parallel to the cutting board, and make 2 or 3 more cuts to form the bristles of the broom. Press a pretzel stick into the uncut end of the cheese stick to make the handle. Tie a chive in the middle of top (uncut) end of the cheese stick; this holds the broom head together. Repeat for the remaining brooms. Spread the mustard haphazardly on the bottom of a black or white plate. Stand the brooms up on their bristles as if they are sweeping up the mustard. <|endoftext|>

 1 1/4 cups sugar 
 8 eggs, separated 
 1 cup almond meal 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 4 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/4 cup evaporated milk 
 1/4 cup almond liqueur 
 1 cup water 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 1/4 cup almond liqueur 
 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature 
 1 cup cream cheese, room temperature 
 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted 
 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice

 White chocolate curls, fans, etc., optional 
 Powdered sugar 
 Instructions: 
 For the almond cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter and line with parchment. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, fully combining before each addition. Keep mixing until light and pale. Add the almond meal and mix to combine. In another bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder to combine. Set aside. Combine the evaporated milk and almond liqueur. Set aside. With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding one-third of the flour mixture and one-half of the evaporated milk mixture to the creamed butter. Start and end with the flour, and do not overmix. With a hand mixer or stand mixer, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gently fold into the batter. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops are golden and spring back when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then run a paring knife or mini offset spatula around the pans and unmold the cakes onto a rack. Let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. For the almond liqueur simple syrup: Whisk the water and sugar together in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn off the burner and let cool for about 20 minutes Once cooled, stir in almond liqueur. Reserve. For the key lime buttercream: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and cream cheese together until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, and then add the lime juice and zest. Scrape down the bowl and mix for another 5 minutes, until satiny and fluffy. Reserve. For the raspberry compote: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the raspberries, blackberries, sugar, water and lime juice. Cook until you can start to crush the berries with the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Cook for another 5 minutes to thicken a bit. Remove from the heat and set aside. To assemble: Slice each cake horizontally into two equal layers. Place the first layer, cut-side up, on a cake board. Using a pastry brush, brush the surface with about 3 tablespoons of the almond syrup. Transfer the buttercream to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip and pipe a border around the edge of the cake. With a mini offset spatula, spread a thin layer of buttercream in the center of the cake layer. Then, staying inside the piped border, spread a thin layer of the raspberry compote on top of the buttercream. Place another cake layer, cut-side up, on top. Repeat with the rest of the layers. To decorate the top of the cake: Pipe a border of buttercream beads around the edge and then spread with a thin layer of buttercream. Top with blackberries, raspberries, and white chocolate decorations if using. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and enjoy. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 2/3 to 1 3/4 pounds ground sirloin 
 1 medium onion, cut into chunks 
 2 ribs celery from the heart of the stalk, cut into 2-inch pieces 
 1 green bell pepper 
 1 large egg plus a splash of milk, beaten 
 1 cup plain bread crumbs 
 2 tablespoons grill seasoning (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) 
 1 cup smoky barbecue sauce 
 1/2 cup tomato salsa 
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
 Vegetable oil or extra-virgin olive oil 
 Micro-way-cool Bacon and Green Beans, recipe follows 
 Smashed potatoes and cream cheese, recipe follows 
 6 slices microwave ready-crisp bacon 
 One 16-ounce bag frozen green beans 
 A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil 
 Salt and pepper 
 2 1/2 pounds small red potatoes or baby Yukon gold potatoes 
 1/2 cup half-and-half or whole milk 
 8 ounces plain cream cheese or veggie cream cheese, cut into pieces 
 10 chives or 2 scallions, chopped or snipped with kitchen scissors 
 Salt and pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Put ground beef into a big bowl. Put onion and celery into a food processor. Cut the bell pepper in half, rip out the seeds and throw them into your garbage bowl. Cut the pepper into a few pieces and add to the food processor. Pulse the processor blades to finely chop the vegetables into very small pieces then add them to the meat bowl. Add egg, beaten with milk, bread crumbs and grill seasoning to the bowl. Next, mix together the smoky barbecue sauce, the salsa and the Worcestershire sauce. Pour half the sauce mixture into the bowl with the meatloaf mix. Mix the meatloaf together with your hands. Wash up. Brush a 12-muffin tin (1/2-cup each) with vegetable oil or extra-virgin olive oil. Use an ice cream scoop to help you fill meat into a each tin. Top each meat loaf with a spoonful of extra sauce. Bake about 20 minutes. Cut open 1 muffin to test that the middle is cooked through. While meatloaf muffins bake, make green beans in the microwave. Serve meatloaf with Smashed Potatoes and Cream Cheese on the side, too. Place bacon between paper towels and microwave 60 seconds on high. Cool bacon and chop or crumble up. Place green beans in a bowl and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and microwave green beans on high for 5 minutes, stir and cook 5 minutes more. Remove wrap and top green beans with crumbled bacon. Boil potatoes until tender, 15 minutes. While the water boils and when the potatoes are cooking, you can be working on the meatloaf recipe. When the potatoes are tender, drain them and return them to the hot pot to let them dry out a bit. Mash potatoes with half-and-half or milk using a potato masher. Add in the cream cheese and smash until the cheese melts into the potatoes. Then add chives and scallions and season with salt and pepper, to your taste. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 5 packed teaspoons fresh compressed yeast (from a 2-ounce cake) 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Pinch sugar 
 1 cup cold water 
 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 3 tablespoons whole-wheat flour 
 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 
 5 cups young fresh robiola (cheese) 
 5 tablespoons semolina 
 5 tablespoons white truffle oil 
 1-ounce shaved white truffles 
 Instructions: 
 In small bowl, stir together yeast, oil, sugar, and about 3 tablespoons water until smooth. Stir in remaining water. In large bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook whisk together 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, and salt.

 1 teaspoon chile flakes 
 1 teaspoon ground coriander 
 5 large cloves garlic 
 1 yellow onion, chopped 
 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped 
 1/2 bunch fresh curly parsley, chopped 
 1/4 cup white sesame seeds 
 3/4 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 6 ounces feta 
 6 cloves garlic, roasted 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 4 cups white flour, plus more for dusting 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 2 tablespoons yeast 
 1 cup wheatberry flour or 2/3 cup wheatberries, milled in blender then sifted 
 1/4 cup honey 
 1/4 cup good quality olive oil, plus more for greasing 
 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 For the falafels: Fill a large skillet halfway up the side with oil. Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Place the chickpeas, flour, cumin, salt, turmeric, chile flakes, coriander, garlic, onions, cilantro and parsley in a food processor, and pulse until ground down to a coarse cornmeal consistency. Chill for 10 minutes in the fridge. Once chilled, scoop about 2 ounce balls of the falafel mix, and roll in the sesame seeds. Fry the balls, no more than 5 at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Set the falafels on a paper-towel-lined sheet pan or plate as they come out of the oil to drain. For the mousse: Dissolve the gelatin in 1 tablespoon water. Combine the heavy cream, feta and garlic in a sauce pot and heat until the feta slightly melts, 2 minutes. Pull off the heat and stir in the gelatin and olive oil. Then place in a blender and blend until very smooth. Scoop the mixture into a shallow bowl or container and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate or blast chill, and set aside. For the pita: Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups warm water, the flour, sugar and yeast. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for 10 minutes. Place the honey, olive oil, salt and dough mixture into a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Beat until the dough is soft, 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured cutting board and cut into 4 to 8 pieces. Roll the pieces into round dough balls, and then flatten using your hands or a rolling pin to 1/2-inch thick and 4- to 6-inch round. Place the dough rounds onto an oil-greased sheet tray and bake until the dough is cooked, 2 to 4 minutes. To serve, layer the mousse and falafel on top of the pita bread (taco-style), and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup whole-grain or Dijon mustard 
 2 tablespoons dry mustard 
 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 
 1 tablespoon kosher salt 
 2 eggs 
 1 1/2 cups whole milk 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 2 boneless pork tenderloins (about 3 to 4 pounds total) 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 Gala apples, small diced 
 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 1 jalapeno, minced 
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 tablespoons ground cumin 
 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
 1 tablespoon kosher salt 
 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped 
 Instructions: 
 Spaetzle: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard, dry mustard, Parmesan and salt. Then add eggs and milk and stir together using a metal or wooden spoon. The consistency should be a thick batter, a little thicker than pancake batter. When the water comes to a boil put a colander over the pot and pour in the batter. Using a rubber spatula, force the batter through the holes of the colander so it falls in little drops into the water. Cook for just a minute. When the spaetzle float to the surface, they are cooked. Strain and immediately rinse with cold water to cool and stop the cooking process. Lay the spaetzle out on a cookie sheet to dry a little bit. Pork: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat a large, oven-proof saute pan over high heat. Add canola oil and when it starts to smoke add the pork. Liberally season the pork with salt and pepper, to taste. Sear the pork on all sides to get a real good deep brown color all over the pork. Transfer the pan to the oven to finish cooking. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the pork registers 138 degrees F, about 10 to 15 minutes for medium-well. Remove the pork from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Salsa: While the pork is cooking, make the salsa. In a large bowl, add the apples, the vinegar and lemon juice and toss to coat and to prevent them from turning brown. Add the jalapeno, oil, spices and salt and mix thoroughly. Stir in the cilantro, cover and refrigerate. It will keep up to 1 day. In a large saute pan heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke add the spaetzle and turn the heat to medium-high. Let the spaetzle sit for a minute to get brown, then stir and brown for another minute. You are looking for nice crisp, golden brown pieces of pasta. (They shouldn't stick if you made them right. If they do stick, it means the batter was too loose from the start. If the batter was too loose just add a little more flour the next time.) With a slotted spoon, remove the spaetzle from the oil and to a platter. Top with slices of pork loin and a generous helping of the salsa right over the top. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

Crack eggs into a measuring cup and beat in 1 at a time. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and allspice. Gradually add large spoonfuls of the dry mixture into the creamed mixture. Once incorporated, fold in raisins, pecans, and oats with a rubber spatula. Add a small ice cream scoop of dough (about 2 inches in diameter), onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets, spacing about 1-inch apart. Pat top down slightly and bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool completely for 45 minutes before making sandwiches. Remove ice cream from the freezer and allow to soften. Turn 6 cookies face side up on counter. Scoop 1/2-cup of ice cream on the cookies and using an offset spatula, spread evenly to the edges. Top ice cream with a second cookie and press down to adhere. Roll ice cream edges in the chopped pecans. Freeze for 2 hours or until solid. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 1/2 pounds whole cut-up chicken 
 2 (5-ounce) packets chicken fry coating (recommended: Dixie Fry) 
 2 tablespoons salt-free chicken seasoning, divided (recommended: McCormick Grill Mates) 
 Canola oil, for frying 
 2 (12-ounce) jars roasted chicken gravy (recommended: Franco American) 
 1 teaspoon crushed garlic 
 Instructions: 
 Cut away excess skin and fat from chicken pieces. Rinse with cold water and set aside; do not pat dry. In a shallow bowl, stir together fry coating and 1 tablespoon chicken seasoning. Dredge chicken pieces in coating mixture; set aside. In a large straight-sided pan, heat 1/2-inch oil over medium-high heat. Oil is ready for frying when a drop of water splatters when dropped in. Fry coated chicken until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pan and drain oil. In a medium bowl, stir together gravy, remaining chicken seasoning, and crushed garlic; set aside. Return chicken to pan over medium heat. Cover with gravy. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes or until completely done (no pink near the bone). Serve hot. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 cups chopped onions, leeks or scallions 
 2 cups diced celery 
 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage 
 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 3 cups low-sodium chicken or turkey broth 
 1 bunch kale 
 2 large eggs 
 1/4 cup chopped parsley 
 1 pound andouille sausage, cooked and crumbled 
 Instructions: 
 Chop the potato bread into 1/2-inch cubes to make 16 cups. Stale bread works best for stuffing-if yours is fresh, spread out the cubes on baking sheet and dry in a 300 degrees F oven, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat 1 stick butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, sage, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth; bring to a simmer and remove from the heat. Meanwhile, stem and chop the kale and blanch for 2 minutes. Beat the eggs and parsley in a large bowl; stir in the bread cubes, the vegetable-broth mixture and the prepared kale. Stir in the sausage. Transfer the mixture to a buttered 3-to-4-quart baking dish and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cover with foil and bake at 375 degrees F, 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden, about 20 more minutes. Photograph by Yunhee Kim <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 egg yolks 
 6 tablespoons sugar, divided 
 4 egg whites 
 1/2 cup all purpose flour, sifted 
 Parchment paper 
 1 recipe chocolate ice cream 
 1 recipe coconut sorbet 
 2 quart ice cream bombe mold 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Whip the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons sugar until creamy and yellow. Whip the egg whites to soft peaks and add the remaining sugar to the whites. Continue to whip the whites to stiff peaks. Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk/sugar combination. Using the same care, fold in the sifted flour. Line a cookie sheet with the baker=s parchment paper, pour the cake batter, and spread the batter out to evenly coat the pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Cool the cake quickly near an open window and on a rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Assemble the baked Alaska by cutting the sponge cake to the basic shape of the bombe mold. The largest piece will be used for lining the mold and a smaller piece will be used for the top which later will be inverted to become the bottom. Line the bombe mold with plastic wrap and then line the plastic with the larger piece of baked and cooled cake. Remove the ice cream and sorbet from the freezer and allow to soften for 10 minutes. Spoon or scoop the sorbet first into the cake lined mold and create an even layer on the bottom (later the top) of the mold. Cover the sorbet with the ice cream in the same fashion, smoothing out the ice cream as you go, into one even layer. Place the remaining layer of cake on top of the ice cream layer to act as a seal and place the whole bombe into the freezer for 4 to 5 hours. This can be done well in advance of finishing the baked Alaska. To finish the Alaska whip the egg whites to soft peaks, add the sugar and continue to whip to stiff but not dry peaks. Pour the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tube and unmold the bombe. Use hot towels to help loosen the bombe if necessary and invert the bombe onto a heat proof serving platter. Remove the plastic wrap and pipe a decorative design of meringue all around the base of the, now revealed, cake covered bombe. Cover the entire bombe with this meringue in as decorative a design as you can manage, being as creative as you like, but working quickly to avoid melting too much of the ice cream and sorbet. The baked Alaska is now ready for a quick visit to the very hot oven to brown the meringue but not melt the ice cream. Place the Alaska into the oven for just 5 minutes to brown the meringue to a light golden color. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup (500 grams) almond paste, recipe follows 
 3 tablespoons (50 grams) corn syrup 
 3 tablespoons (50 grams) apricot puree 
 1 to 3 egg whites 
 Whole blanched almonds, optional 
 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (250 grams) sugar 
 1/4 cup (75 grams) honey 
 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons (100 grams) water 
 3 cups plus 3 tablespoons (500 grams) blanched, whole, almonds 
 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (50 grams) Kirsch or simple syrup, optional 
 1/4 cup (50 grams) butter 
 Instructions: 
 Place the almond paste, corn syrup and apricot puree in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. Turn on the mixer to medium speed and add about 1 egg white, continue adding egg white gradually until the mixture can be piped through a piping bag. You will need to adjust the amount of egg whites added to the mixture depending on the consistency of the almond paste. Place the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the mixture onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Use any design you like when you are piping the mixture. You can place whole almonds on top of some to achieve a different design. Preheat the oven to 380 degrees F and bake for 8 to10 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Place the sugar, honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining, you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is. Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it, knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky. Yield: About 2 cups <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 pounds mussels, well washed 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 8 ounces rigatoni or other cut pasta 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 
 1/4 teaspoon red chile flakes, or to taste 
 1 cup cooked cannellini or borlotti beans, drained 
 2 tablespoons dry white wine 
 1 cup chopped fresh parsley 
 Instructions: 
 Put mussels in a large pot with a lid. Cover, turn heat to medium-high and when you hear the mussel liquid boiling, reduce heat to maintain a steady bubble; you will hear it and see steam escaping. Shake pot now and then; when mussels open, remove them. Let cool slightly and shuck, reserving cooking liquid. When liquid has cooled, strain it. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil, cook pasta until not quite done (figure about 2 minutes short of where you would usually cook it), drain and set aside. Put oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic and chile flakes and cook for about 1 minute. Add beans, wine, pasta, and mussels; reduce heat to medium-low and stir to combine. Add as much reserved mussel liquid as mixture can accommodate without becoming too soupy. Cook, stirring gently, until pasta is fully cooked and everything is warmed through; add more liquid if you like. Adjust seasoning as needed, drizzle with a bit more olive oil if you like, sprinkle with parsley and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 pound fiddleheads cleaned, procedure follows 
 1/2 pound baby pattypan squash, trimmed 
 1/2 pound baby carrots, trimmed 
 3/4 cup shelled fresh peas 
 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter 
 1/2 pound pearl onions, blanched in boiling water for 1 minute, peeled, and trimmed 
 2 thyme sprigs 
 1 bay leaf 
 1 cup chicken broth 
 1/4 pound fresh morels washed well, patted dry, and trimmed 
 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves 
 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves 
 1 large garlic clove, minced 
 Instructions: 
 In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the fiddleheads for 4 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and transfer them to paper towels to drain. In the kettle boil the squash and the carrots for 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, transfer the vegetables with the slotted spoon to the bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and transfer them to paper towels to drain. In the kettle boil the peas for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are just tender, and drain them. In a large heavy skillet combine 2 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, the thyme, the bay leaf, 1/4 cup of the broth, and salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Add the morels, halved lengthwise or sliced crosswise, and 1/2 cup of the remaining broth and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes, or until the morels are tender. Add the fiddleheads, the squash, the carrots, and the remaining 1/4 cup broth and simmer the mixture, covered, for 1 minute. Add the peas, the parsley, the mint, and the garlic, simmer the ragout, covered, for 1 minute, and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cut into bits, stirring until the butter is just melted. Discard the bay leaf and season the ragout with salt and pepper. TO CLEAN FRESH-PICKED FIDDLEHEADS: Snap off the crisp, bright green fiddlehead tops from ostrich ferns, leaving about 2 inches of stem attached. Rub off the dry brown casings by hand or put the fiddleheads in a wire salad basket and whirl the basket outdoors to remove the casings. Let the fiddleheads soak in a sink half full of cold water, changing the water several times to remove any grit or casing particles, and drain them. The fiddleheads keep, covered and chilled, for 1 week; <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 Mint or orange flavoring, optional 
 8 ounces chocolate, cut into small pieces 
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper powder (to desired hotness) 
 2 pounds chopped chocolate, for coating 
 Cocoa, ground nuts, powdered sugar, espresso beans, for garnishing, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Boil the cream and set aside to cool to lukewarm. Add the mint or orange flavoring, if using, and stir well. Melt the cut chocolate over a double boiler. Add the cayenne and mix well. Whisk the chocolate and cream together and cover. Refrigerate until mixture can be formed into small balls, about 45 minutes. Form small balls and place on a pan. Freeze the truffle balls until frozen, about 1 hour. After the truffle balls are frozen, melt the chopped chocolate over a double boiler, and put into a shallow baking pan. In small batches, so that they stay firm, roll the truffle balls in melted chocolate for about 5 seconds each. Shake off excess chocolate and place on a lined baking sheet, sprinkle with garnish if using. Put the finished truffles in the refrigerator. Cook's Note: Because the dipping chocolate has not been tempered, the truffles, if not kept refrigerated, will get a white cast or white streaks, known as blooming. This is only visual and will not affect the taste. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 cup pure olive oil 
 3/4 cup red vermouth, Marsala, sweet sherry, or other sweet wine such as Vin Santo 
 2 large eggs 
 4 to 6 cups peanut or vegetable oil, for deep-frying 
 About 2 cups honey, warm 
 Instructions: 
 Sift together the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the olive oil, vermouth, and eggs until well blended. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the mixture forms a cohesive mass. Scrape the dough onto a very lightly floured board. Knead lightly until smooth. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten, and place in a bowl. Dust the top lightly with flour, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax. If necessary, lightly dust the work surface with flour. Cut the dough into 6 or 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch pieces. Shape into "gnocchi" with a gnocchi board, butter paddle, or on the back side of the tines of a fork. The deeper the grooves on the cookies the better as they puff up as they fry and the ridges, unless deep, tend to disappear. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep pan to 350 degrees F. Fry the cookies in about 4 batches until puffed and medium to dark brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. It is easiest to pile the cookies in a sieve or fry basket and then dip them into the hot oil. Each batch should include enough cookies to cover the surface of the oil. Any fewer and the oil gets too hot and browns the cookies before they are cooked through. Stir the cookies while they fry so they do not stick together. The number of cookies you add to the oil and the amount of oil will change the timing. The cookies first turn light gold, then a light brown, and finally almost a light milk chocolate color. Remove just as they get to this color or a little before. Drain on paper towels. While still hot, put the cookies in a large shallow dish and pour the honey over them. Toss the cookies several times as they cool. If the cookies absorb all the honey, add more - they should be fully saturated. Serve in a pretty bowl or store in a covered container. They will keep for about 1 week. Chef's Notes: Starting with a 1/2-inch piece of dough yields a cookie about 1 inch long, perfect for popping in your mouth all at once. They can be made smaller or larger, depending on your preference. Two hundred sounds like a lot of cookies. But once you taste one you will understand why you should be thinking about making several batches in quick succession. <|endoftext|>

 Instructions: 
 Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, the oregano, mustard and garlic. Coat the lamb and let stand for 1/2 hour at room temperature. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add the lamb and sear on all sides, turning often to achieve good even color, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and chill in the freezer 20 minutes until cold. Slice the lamb as thinly as possible. Pound the slices between layers of waxed paper until paper-thin. To serve, arrange the lamb slices on a salad plate. Top with Greek Salad and Lamb Turnovers. In a large mixing bowl, combine the lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, olives, olive oil, parsley, scallions and lemon juice, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon butter, garlic and shallots. Cook until soft. Add the ground lamb and cook until done. Remove the mixture to a bowl and cool for 5 minutes. Add the feta, herbs and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper. Melt the remaining 1 stick butter in a small saucepan, and then cool. Cover the phyllo stack with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and then a dampened kitchen towel. Arrange 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface, with a long side nearest you. Keep the remaining sheets covered. Brush with some melted butter. Top with another phyllo sheet and brush with more butter. Cut the buttered phyllo stack lengthwise into 6 strips. Put a heaping teaspoon of lamb filling near one corner of a strip on the end nearest you, and then fold the corner of the phyllo over to enclose the filling and form a triangle. Continue folding the strip, like a flag, maintaining a triangle shape. Put the triangle, seam-side down, on a large baking sheet and brush the top with butter. Make more triangles in the same manner, using all of the phyllo sheet and filling, making 12 turnover. Bake the triangles in the middle of the oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound baking potatoes (about 2 large), scrubbed thoroughly 
 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus 8 tablespoons (1 stick) 
 2 tablespoons minced shallots 
 1 teaspoon minced garlic 
 8 ounces farmer's cheese 
 5 ounces goat cheese 
 2 ounces mascarpone 
 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup freshly grated 
 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves 
 2 tablespoons minced fresh chervil leaves 
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper 
 Basic Pasta Dough, recipe follows 
 Semolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting 
 1 egg lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 
 1/4 cup toasted and chopped hazelnuts 
 3 cups flour 
 8 large egg yolks 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 3 to 5 tablespoons water 
 Semolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting 
 Instructions: 
 Make the filling: Bake the potatoes in a preheated 350 degree F. oven until fork tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Peel, and while still warm, pass through a food mill. In a small saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until soft. In a medium bowl, combine the farmer's cheese, goat cheese, mascarpone, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, the herbs, and the beaten egg. Add the cooked shallots and garlic and the warm potato. Stir until blended (being careful not to overmix, or the mixture will get pasty). Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Then, with lightly moistened hands, roll into 1/2-ounce balls, about the size of golf balls. Cut the pasta dough into 4 portions and work with 1 portion at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with plastic wrap. Lightly dust the work surface with flour. With a pasta machine or a rolling pin, roll out the dough about 20 inches long and 4 inches wide. Brush the dough with egg wash and arrange 9 to 10 balls of filling on the lower third of the length of the dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. Fold the top half over to cover the balls. Press the dough around each ball to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets. With a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the ravioli. Dust a tray with flour and arrange the ravioli on the tray, dusting with more flour. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, over high heat, add the oil and the remaining butter. Cook the butter until it begins to brown. Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides. Add the remaining Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and hazelnuts and serve immediately. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it's too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 or more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don't have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup pitted chopped dates 
 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening 
 3/4 cup boiling water 
 2 eggs 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup whole wheat flour 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 Instructions:

 4 pasillas Mexicanos, seeded and deveined; seeds reserved 
 4 anchos negros, seeded and deveined; seeds reserved 
 2 chipotles mecos, seeded and deveined; seeds reserved 
 1/2 head garlic, cloves separated 
 2 tablespoons whole almonds 
 2 tablespoons shelled and skinned raw peanuts 
 1 (1-inch) piece Mexican cinnamon 
 3 black peppercorns 
 3 whole cloves 
 3 tablespoons sunflower oil 
 1 1/2 tablespoons raisins 
 1 slice egg-dough bread 
 1 small ripe plantain, cut into 1/2-inch slices 
 1/2-cup sesame seeds 
 2 pecan halves 
 1/2 pound chopped tomatoes 
 1/4 pound chopped tomatillos 
 1 sprig thyme, or 1/2 tsp. dried 
 1 sprig Oaxacan oregano, or 1/2 tsp. dried 
 2 tablespoons lard 
 4 1/2 ounces Mexican chocolate 
 1 avocado leaf 
 Salt, to taste 
 4 large onions, chopped, plus 1 medium onion, quartered 
 8 ribs celery, chopped 
 8 carrots, chopped 
 Instructions: 
 In a 2 gallon stockpot, heat 5 quarts water and onions, celery, and carrots to a boil. Add chicken pieces and poach, covered, over low heat for about 35 to 45 minutes, until cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Remove the meat from the stock. Strain and reserve the stock. Heat 2 quarts of water in a kettle. On a 10-inch dry comal, griddle, or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles over medium heat until blackened, but not burnt, about 10 minutes. Place the chiles in a large bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 1/2 hour. Remove the chiles from the soaking water with tongs, placing small batches in a blender with 1/4 cup of the chile soaking water to blend smooth. Put the chile puree through a strainer to remove the skins. In the same dry comal, griddle, or frying pan, grill the onion and garlic over medium heat for 10 minutes. Set aside. Toast the almonds, peanuts, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in a dry comal, griddle or cast-iron frying pan for about 5 minutes. Remove them from the pan. Over the same heat, toast the chile seeds, taking care to blacken but not burn them, about 20 minutes. Try to do this outside or in a well-ventilated place because the seeds will give off very strong fumes. When the seeds are completely black, light them with a match and let them burn themselves out. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl. Soak the blackened seeds in 1 cup of cold water for 10 minutes. Drain the seeds and grind them in a blender for about 2 minutes. Add the blended chile seeds to the blended chile mixture. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in an 8-inch cast-iron frying pan over medium heat until smoking. Add the raisins and fry them until they are plump, approximately 1 minute. Remove from the pan. Fry the bread slice in the same oil until browned, about 5 minutes, over medium heat. Remove from pan. Fry the plantain in the same oil until it is well browned, approximately 10 minutes, over medium heat. Set aside. Fry the sesame seeds, stirring constantly over low heat, adding more oil if needed. When the sesame seeds start to brown, about 5 minutes, add the pecans and brown for 2 minutes more. Remove all from the pan, let cool, and grind finely in a spice grinder. It takes a bit of time, but this is the only way to grind the seeds and nuts finely enough. Wipe out the frying pan and fry the tomatoes, tomatillos, thyme, and oregano over medium to high heat, allowing the juices to almost evaporate, about 15 minutes. Blend well, using 1/2 cup of reserved stock if needed to blend and set aside. Place the nuts, bread, plantains, raisins, onion, garlic and spices in the blender in small batches, and blend well, adding about 1 cup of stock to make it smooth. In a heavy 4-quart stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of lard or oil until smoking and fry the chile paste over medium to low heat, stirring constantly so it will not burn, approximately 20 minutes. When it is dry, add the tomato puree and fry until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the ground ingredients, including the sesame seed paste, to the pot. Stir constantly with a wooden soon until well-incorporated, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock to the mole, stir well, and allow to cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Break up the chocolate and add to the pot, stirring until it is melted and incorporated into the mixture. Toast the avocado leaf briefly over the flame if you have a gas range or in a dry frying pan and then add it to the pot. Slowly add more stock to the mole, as it will keep thickening as it cooks. Add enough salt to bring out the flavor. Let simmer another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally so it does not stick, adding stock as needed. The mole should not be thick; just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Place the cooked chicken pieces in the leftover stock in a saucepan and heat through. To serve, place a piece of chicken in a shallow bowl and ladle 3/4 of a cup of mole sauce over to cover it completely. Serve immediately with lots of hot corn tortillas. You can use oil instead of lard to fry the mole, but the flavor will change dramatically. In our pueblo, people traditionally use turkey instead of chicken, and sometimes add pieces of pork and beef to enhance the flavor. You can use leftover mole and chicken meat to make Enmoladas or Tamales Oazaquenos made with banana leaves. Inspired by Maria Taboada and Paula Martinez <|endoftext|>

 6 garlic cloves, cut into strips 
 2 medium white onions, peeled and thinly sliced 
 5 bay leaves 
 10 sprigs thyme 
 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 
 1 tablespoon whole allspice 
 Avocado Filling, recipe follows 
 45 avocados, peeled and finely chopped 
 1 small white onion, peeled and finely chopped 
 1/4 cup cilantro, finely chopped 
 3 small serrano chiles or 1 small jalapeno chile, finely chopped 
 Juice of 2 limes 
 Sea salt, to taste 
 Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Wash the chiles in warm water, carefully slit them open on one side, and remove the seeds and veins. Bring the white vinegar, red vinegar, and water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the piloncillo, oil, and salt. Heat until the piloncillo melts. Add the garlic, onions, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns and allspice. Cook about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the chiles. Place all of the Chiles Anchos en Escabeche in a covered container and marinate one day at room temperature. They will hold, refrigerated, at least 1 week. Prepare the Avocado Filling just before serving. Drain the chiles and stuff with the Avocado Filling. Arrange on a serving platter and drench with the marinade. Decorate with the onion and garlic drained from the marinade. (The chiles may be sliced in half lengthwise and stuffed, for smaller portions.) Mash the avocados with a fork and stir in the onions, cilantro, chiles, and lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 extra-large egg 
 4 extra-large egg yolks 
 1/2 cup sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for each serving 
 3 cups heavy cream 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1 tablespoon orange liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the egg, egg yolks, and 1/2 cup of the sugar together on low speed until just combined. Meanwhile, scald the cream in a small saucepan until it's very hot to the touch but not boiled. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the cream to the eggs. Add the vanilla and orange liqueur and pour into 6 to 8-ounce ramekins until almost full. Place the ramekins in a baking pan and carefully pour boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the custards are set when gently shaken. Remove the custards from the water bath, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until firm. To serve, spread 1 tablespoon of sugar evenly on the top of each ramekin and heat with a kitchen blowtorch until the sugar carmelizes evenly. Allow to sit at room temperature for a minute until the caramelized sugar hardens. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups half-and-half 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 
 1 cinnamon stick 
 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 9 egg yolks 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 Instructions: 
 In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the half-and-half, cream, vanilla, cinnamon stick and ground cinnamon, whisking occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn?t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and let the flavors infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar. In a thin stream, whisk half of the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don?t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, in a bowl, put two handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Pour the cream mixture through a fine sieve or chinois (to remove the vanilla bean pieces and cinnamon sticks) and into the smaller bowl. Chill 3 hours, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 8 slices thick-cut bacon 
 2 pounds (about 24) extra large sea scallops 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 cups corn kernels (from 2 ears) 
 2 cups fresh lima beans, peeled, blanched in boiling salted water for 30 seconds; or thawed frozen lima beans 
 1 large tomato, cored, cut into small cubes 
 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 
 8 (8-inch) skewers 
 Instructions: 
 Build a multi-level fire in the grill: Leave 1/4 of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining 3/4 of the grill so that they are 3 times as high on one side as on the other. When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook. In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until it has rendered a good amount of fat, but has not begun color or crinkle up, about 4 minutes (The bacon should be cooked halfway, it should remain pliable). Remove from the heat. Thread the scallops onto skewers, putting 3 on each skewer, zig-zagging with a piece of bacon around each trio of scallops, securing it at the top and bottom with toothpicks, or secure with a second skewer. Sprinkle the skewers generously with salt and pepper, then place on grill over the side with fewer coals and cook until scallops are opaque all the way through, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn, lima beans, tomato, sage, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the ingredients are nice and hot, about 5 minutes. To serve, place about 1/4 of the succotash on each plate, top with 2 skewers. Cook's note: Try to use the largest scallops available, if dry scallops are available, it's even better. When grilling scallops watch carefully for any flare-ups. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 ounces fish sauce 
 6 ounces water 
 1 tablespoons chile garlic sauce 
 2 limes, juiced 
 2 ounces sugar 
 1 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water 
 2 tablespoons chopped scallion 
 2 cups vegetable oil 
 1 whole red snapper (about 1 1/2 pounds), scaled, eviscerated, and fins removed 
 Salt and pepper 
 Flour 
 Serving suggestion: Steamed rice 
 Instructions: 
 Mix the fish sauce, water, chile garlic sauce, the lime juice, and sugar together in a small pan and bring to a boil. Fill a large heavy saute pan with 1-inch of oil and heat for 5 minutes until hot, but not smoking. Make 2 diagonal cuts on each side of the fish for ease of cooking. Salt, pepper, and flour both sides of the fish. Fish should be dry, as to not splatter oil when frying. Lower fish into oil, the oil should bubble vigorously. Cook 4 minutes on each side until golden brown. Check cuts on fish for doneness. When fish is almost cooked, heat up sauce and stir in cornstarch mixture while sauce is boiling. Sauce should be slightly thick, but not lumpy. Remove fish from oil and slightly dry with paper towels. Add scallions to the sauce and pour over fish to cover.

 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon of butter 
 1 small onion, finely chopped 
 1 carrot, finely chopped 
 1 stalk celery, finely chopped 
 2 tablespoons dry white wine 
 1 pound halibut steaks 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 cup or more fish stock or chicken broth 
 Steamed carrot threads or pea pods for garnish 
 Black sesame seeds for garnish, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Heat the butter in a skillet just wide enough to hold the fish. When hot add the vegetables and saute for a minute or so just to get them sizzling. Add the wine, cover and cook over very low heat until wilted, about 10 minutes. Set halibut over the vegetables, season with salt and pepper and add stock or broth just to cover. Simmer, covered, over low heat, until fish is just done, about 10 minutes. With a slotted spatula, remove haibut from the liquid and divide into two portions.

 Ingredients: 
 4 tablespoons drippings (such as bacon) 
 2 cups finely ground white cornmeal 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 large egg 
 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Put the drippings in a 9-inch cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in the oven and let the drippings heat while you prepare the batter. In a big bowl, mix the cornmeal, salt, and baking soda. Add the egg and buttermilk, and stir until just blended. The drippings should be good and hot, but not smoking, by now. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and swirl gently to coat it with drippings. Pour the rest of the drippings into the batter. It should crackle and pop. Mix quickly and lightly, just to blend, then pour the batter into the skillet and put it back in the oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread is set in the middle, the edges are browned, and the top crust is golden. Serve hot, cut into wedges and lifted straight out of the skillet. If you prefer, turn the skillet upside down and let the cornbread slip out on a big plate. If your cast-iron is seasoned well, it will do so easily. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Cooking spray, for the baking pan 
 1 1/2 cups corn syrup 
 1 cup sugar 
 3/4 cup whole milk 
 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 teaspoons Homemade Vanilla Extract, recipe follows, or store-bought vanilla extract 
 3 vanilla beans 
 8 to 12 ounces bourbon or vodka 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a candy thermometer Spray the bottom of an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Line the baking pan with overlapping pieces of parchment, leaving enough to hang over the sides of the pan; this will help you remove the fudge from the pan. Spray the pieces of parchment with cooking spray. Combine the corn syrup, sugar, whole milk, cocoa powder and butter in a heavy-bottom saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and butter melt. Stop stirring and let the mixture continue to cook until the thermometer reaches 238 degrees F, 7 to 10 minutes. Once the mixture reaches 238 degrees F, stir in the vanilla extract and turn off the heat immediately. Pour the spoon fudge into the prepared 8-by-8-inch baking pan, tapping gently so the fudge is evenly distributed. Cool to room temperature, and then place in the refrigerator to set until firm enough to cut, about 1 hour. Once the fudge is set, use the parchment to lift the candy out of the baking pan onto a cutting board. Peel off the parchment. Cut the fudge into 1-by-2-inch pieces and wrap each with waxed paper. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve or up to 1 week. Split the vanilla beans lengthwise, leaving them attached at one end. Place them in a 10- to 12-ounce bottle and cover with the liquor. Put on the top and shake vigorously. Store at room temperature for 4 weeks to let the flavor develop and mature, shaking the bottle once a week. The extract will keep at room temperature in a dark place (like your cabinet) for up to 6 months. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Focaccia Dough: 
 4 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 1 (1/4-ounce) package Red Star QuickRise Yeast 
 1 1/2 cups warm water (120-130 degrees) 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Oil Baste: 
 1/8 cup olive oil 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 
 2 cloves minced garlic 
 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 
 Toppings: 
 1 cup sundried tomatoes, pureed 
 1 cup sliced Georgia Pecans 
 1 (14-ounce) can small artichoke hearts, cut into quarters 
 1 (6-ounce) can pitted small black olives, drained and cut in half 
 1 pound cooked shrimp 21-25 size, shell and tail removed 
 6 ounces Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar, cut into twenty-four 2-inch strips 
 Instructions: 
 Food Processor Method - Place the focaccia dough ingredients into a food processor with a dough blade attached. Turn on low setting until the dough ingredients combine and form a ball. Stand Mixer Method - Combine Focaccia Dough ingredients, except 2 1/2 cups flour, in mixing bowl with paddle or beaters for 4 minutes on medium speed. Using a dough hook, gradually add remaining flour and knead for 5 to 7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place dough ball in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to oil top. Cover with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or until dough doubles in size. Dough is ready when you stick 2 fingers in it and the indentations remain. This is referred to as 'ripe.' Place dough on a lightly oiled sheet pan and press down to fit the shape of the pan. With a fork, poke holes all over the dough. In a bowl, combine the 3 Oil Baste ingredients. NOTE: This can be made in advance. Brush this 'baste' over top of dough and spread out the basil and garlic mixture. Sprinkle with sea salt. Place in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 20 minutes and/or the dough is brown on bottom. Remove & cool. Cut focaccia into 24 pieces. Spread each piece with the sun dried tomato spread. Place on each piece 1 teaspoon sliced pecans, 2 pieces of artichoke hearts, 2 black olive halves, 1 shrimp and place a cheese strip down the middle of the focaccia. Place the Seriously Sharp Shrimp Focaccia pieces under the broiler until cheese starts to melt. Remove and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 small apples, peeled, cored and chopped (about 2 1/2 cups) 
 2 cups frozen raspberries 
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
 2 teaspoons cornstarch 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pan 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 cup packed light-brown or dark-brown sugar 
 1 large egg 
 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch square baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, beat the butter and the brown sugar with an electric mixture on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes.

 Ingredients: 
 6 large boiling potatoes (5 to 5 1/2 pounds) 
 Small pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 
 3/4 cup milk 
 Salt to taste 
 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 Instructions: 
 Put the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover them generously with cold water.

 4 tablespoons olive oil 
 1 (7-ounce) potato, peeled, cut into 1/4-inch cubes 
 1/2 onion, chopped 
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 6 large eggs 
 1/4 cup heavy cream 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 
 2 ounces sliced prosciutto, coarsely chopped 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 
 1 baguette, cut into 8 pieces 
 1/4 cup unsalted butter

 Ingredients: 
 2 baby eggplants, cut into 1/2-inch dice and tossed with lemon juice to prevent oxidation 
 2 small zucchini, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
 3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and minced 
 1 large red onion, minced 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil 
 1 shallot, minced 
 1 cup orange juice 
 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
 1 mango, peeled, sliced away from the pit and cut into 1/4-inch dice 
 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley leaves 
 Dash salt 
 1 pinch ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon cornstarch made into a slurry with 1 teaspoon water 
 1 (16-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained 
 2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and quartered 
 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
 1/2 lemon, juiced 
 1 tablespoon tahini 
 2 tablespoons olive oil, preferably extra-virgin 
 Grapeseed oil 
 4 tablespoons 1/4-inch cubes hard and firm tofu 
 16 sheets phyllo dough (based on 18 by 14-inch sheets which are often sold in packs of 18 to 20 for thickness number 4) 
 1 cup melted butter 
 1 or 2 eggs, lightly beaten, for egg wash 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. On a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil for easy cleanup, toss eggplant, zucchini, garlic, and onion with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables for about 30 to 40 minutes until tender, being sure to monitor so they don't burn. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. While the vegetables are in the oven, make the chutney. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a small saucepan until it begins to shimmer. Add the shallot and saute until it begins to turn translucent, being careful not to burn it. Add the orange juice, balsamic vinegar, mango, and parsley, and allow the liquid to reduce by 2/3. Season with salt and pepper, stir in slurry to thicken and let cook for about 2 minutes, then remove from heat. Add the garbanzo beans, garlic, crushed red pepper, lemon juice, tahini, and olive oil to a food processor. Pulse to combine and coarsely chop. Heat grapeseed oil over medium heat in a skillet and sear the tofu cubes. Set aside until needed. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. If phyllo was defrosted, make sure it is completely defrosted before handling it. Once removed from package, you will need to cover phyllo with waxed paper and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay out a dough sheet on a baking sheet and brush on butter, and lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Fold in half, brush on butter again and fold in half again so you have a thickness of 8 layers. Spread 1 tablespoon hummus on phyllo and top with 1/4 cup of the roasted vegetable mixture and 1 tablespoon diced tofu. Fold in corners of phyllo dough to the center and brush with egg wash. Repeat to make 4 phyllo purses. Place on a baking sheet and bake in oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and serve hot with mango chutney on the side. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 
 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
 Fine salt 
 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 
 1 large egg, lightly beaten 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 2 tablespoons meringue powder 
 One 1-pound box confectioners' sugar (3 3/4 to 4 cups) 
 Food coloring, as desired 
 Candy corns, pecans and sanding sugar 
 Instructions: 
 For the cookies: Put the sugar in a food processor and pulse a few times to finely grind. Add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pulse just to combine. Add the butter and pulse until all of the butter is incorporated into the flour and the mixture is sandy. Add the egg and vanilla and pulse until the mixture comes together in big clumps. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to form a ball. Divide the dough in half, pat into 2 discs about 1/4-inch thick, wrap in HYPERLINK "http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/plastic-wrap/index.html" plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Let the dough sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make rolling easier. Put 1 disc of dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Cut out with desired cookie cutters and arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gently gather any scraps into a ball and press into another disc. Chill the disc until firm enough to roll and cut out as many cookies as possible. For the icing: Sift the meringue powder and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl and add 6 tablespoons water. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high until the mixture is glossy and soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add food coloring if using or divide into several batches and color with different shades of food coloring. Decorate cookies as desired. The cookies can be store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/4 pound diced pancetta 
 2 large Spanish onions, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
 Kosher salt 
 4 large garlic cloves, smashed and chopped 
 4 (28-ounce) cans Italian plum San Marzano tomatoes 
 Instructions: 
 Coat a large saucepot with olive oil and add the pancetta. Bring the pot to a medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt and stir to coat with olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes stirring frequently. Pass the tomatoes through the food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That's all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out 1 of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for a few days and freezes really well. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Kosher salt 
 1 cup couscous 
 1/4 cup finely chopped pistachios nuts 
 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 
 Freshly cracked black pepper 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a medium saucepan, salt 1 1/4 cups water and bring to a boil. Whisk in the couscous. Turn off the heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked couscous to a bowl and mix in the nuts, parsley and egg. Season with salt and pepper. With damp hands, form the couscous into 4 patties, about 1-inch thick (about the same thickness of your first thumb joint). Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick pan over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Carefully place the couscous cakes in the pan and cook until golden, turning once, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and serve. BYOC: The thing I love about making cakes is I can really throw anything in there. Sticking with the Middle Eastern theme, dates would add a nice texture to these. Plus, you can break up leftovers in a pan for an alternative to fried rice. You can throw any herb in here - basil, thyme or oregano. <|endoftext|>

 1/2 ounce grated or finely sliced mozzarella cheese 
 2 teaspoons rinsed capers, chopped 
 2 to 4 basil leaves, scissored into threads 
 Salt and pepper 
 12 ounces swordfish cut into 6 thin slices 
 Lemon wedges for garnish 
 4 pitted black olives, sliced 
 Instructions: 
 In a small skillet heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and shrimp and saute for a minute or just until the shrimp turns opaque. Add the white wine and boil down until evaporated. Sprinkle on fresh bread crumbs enough to hold the mixture together. Transfer to a bowl and stir in cheese, capers and basil; season with salt and pepper. Preheat a grill or the oven to 375 degrees. Place the swordfish slices down on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the shrimp stuffing over the slices, to within 1/2 inch of edge and pat into the fish. Roll up and tie into rolls or secure with tooth picks. (If this is too hard to handle, then put stuffing over one slice, and top it with other half like a sandwich; secure with toothpicks.) Thread 3 rolls on a long bamboo skewer (or put "sandwiches" on a baking sheet) bake (on a cookie sheet) or grill for 10 to 15 minutes or until flesh is firm to the touch. Serve immediately garnished with lemon and olives. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 loaves day-old white bread, crusts removed 
 10 pounds ground beef 
 2 medium onions, finely chopped 
 8 whole eggs 
 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves 
 1 cup whole milk 
 Salt and pepper 
 About 3 cups ketchup, or more if desired 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven 350 degrees F. Line 3 (9-by 5-inch) loaf pans with wax paper and set aside. Make bread crumbs by placing the bread in the work bowl of a food processor and processing until finely ground. Transfer crumbs to a large bowl. Add all ingredients, except ketchup, to the bowl; mix until just combined. Divide and shape the meat mixture into loaves in the prepared pans. Spread a layer of ketchup over the top to cover the meat loaf. Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove from heat and let meatloaf cool for 15 minutes before slicing. Serve warm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 7 to 8 ounces of shallots (about 7 or 8 large ones) -if you can?t find shallots, use an equal amount of sweet onions 
 1 1/2 pounds of red-skinned potatoes (about 25 to 28 very small, 3/4 of an inch to 1 1/2 inches in diameter are best, though you can use an equal weight of larger potatoes) 
 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar 
 1/4 cup of olive oil 
 4 stems of fresh rosemary, each about 4 to 6 inches long 
 1 tablespoon of kosher salt (kosher salt will retain its crunchiness in the oven) 
 1 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 1. Peel the shallots, and chop them into pieces roughly 1/2 inch square. Place the pieces into a large non-reactive bowl. 2. Wash the pototoes thoroughly, but do not peel. If you are using small potatoes, cut them into quarters, each in a half-moon shape. If you are using larger potatoes, cut them into quarters, then cut those half-moons in half--the aim is to end up with uniform sized potato pieces that are one-half to no more than 3/4 of an inch on any side. Place the potato pieces into the bowl with the shallots. 3. Pour the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil over the potatoes and shallots. Stir to mix. 4. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stems. Add the leaves to the bowl with the previous ingredients. 5. Add the salt and the pepper to the bowl and stir again to mix. 6. Pour the contents of the bowl into a heavy 9 inch by 13 inch roasting pan (I like to line mine with aluminum foil), or into any baking dish that will allow the potatoes to be in a single layer. 7.Bake at 450 degrees F for 35 to 45 minutes. I like my potatoes pretty dark, so that the balsamic vinegar gets really crunchy on the outsides of the potatoes -if you don?t want them quite so dark, either take them out earlier at the 30 minute mark, or set the oven to 375 degrees F and roast for the full time. Serve hot or at room temperature. The potatoes can be reheated in the oven (400 degrees F for 10 minutes) or in a wrapping of heavy duty aluminum foil. <|endoftext|>

 4 cups oats (NOT quick-cook or instant) 
 11/2 cups whole almonds, shelled, but skin still on 
 1/2 cup flax seeds 
 1/2 cup light brown sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 cup neutral cooking oil (canola) 
 1/4 cup honey

Set aside to cool. For the lemon yogurt: Combine the yogurt, zest and juice in a mixing bowl and stir. To serve, set up glasses and layer with granola, yogurt and berries. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cup mayonnaise 
 Grated zest of 1 lemon 
 Juice of 2 lemons 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 2 (2 pound) lobsters 
 1 tablespoon sweet butter 
 4 hot dog buns 
 1 stalk celery, minced 
 3/4 cup lemon mayonnaise 
 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, minced 
 Salt and pepper to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Make the lemon mayonnaise by mixing all ingredients, and let sit in refrigerator for at least one hour. Steam lobsters for 15 minutes, then place in an ice water bath until cool. Heat a large saute pan over moderate heat. Add butter and when it begins to sizzle, place hot dog buns opened flat inside side down in the pan. When golden brown, turn and cook 1 additional minute. Remove lobster meat from shells, dice and mix with celery, mayonnaise, tarragon, salt and pepper. Mound into buns and serve; <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 6 tablespoons butter at room temperature 
 2 medium leeks, washed and chopped 
 4 tablespoons flour 
 4 cups chicken stock 
 3 stalks celery with leaves, chopped 
 24 freshly shucked oysters, at room temperature (with up to 1/2 cup oyster liquor) 
 24 warm asparagus tips, cooked until just tender 
 2 tablespoons Pernod 
 Fresh tarragon for garnish, if available 
 Instructions: 
 Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a small saucepan. In a heavy -bottomed pot, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the leeks and saute, stirring for 2 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and sprinkle the flour over the leeks. Saute, stirring for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the boiling chicken stock all at once. Beat vigorously with a whisk to incorporate the flour into the stock. Return to boil and add the celery. Reduce to a bare simmer, and cook for 30 minutes. When ready to serve, divide the raw oysters and the cooked asparagus tips among 6 wide, shallow soup bowls. If you find the soup too thick, add some oyster liquor to thin it. Strain the soup, bring it to a boil, add the Pernod, and turn off heat. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter with a whisk. Season to taste and pour immediately over the oysters and asparagus in the soup bowls, keeping the oysters just above the surface of the veloute. Garnish with fresh tarragon leaves, if available. As an appetizer: The best way to use this recipe, we feel. A great start to a late-winter/early-spring dinner that leads, perhaps, into a roast leg of lamb. A wonderful way to serve it is to place the bowls before your guests, with the oysters and asparagus already set in them. Then, bring a tureen to the table and ladle the veloute over all. As a main course: If you simply increase the amount of oysters and asparagus-say 8 per person rather than 4-you'll have a light but filling main-course soup. Serve warmed French bread with it, and a light frilly salad tossed with fresh goat cheese. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 cups sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup cake flour, sifted 
 12 egg whites (the closer to room temperature the better) 
 1/3 cup warm water 
 1 teaspoon orange extract, or extract of your choice 
 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a food processor spin sugar about 2 minutes until it is superfine. Sift half of the sugar with the salt the cake flour, setting the remaining sugar aside. In a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to thoroughly combine egg whites, water, orange extract, and cream of tartar. After 2 minutes, switch to a hand mixer. Slowly sift the reserved sugar, beating continuously at medium speed. Once you have achieved medium peaks, sift enough of the flour mixture in to dust the top of the foam. Using a spatula fold in gently. Continue until all of the flour mixture is incorporated. Carefully spoon mixture into an ungreased tube pan. Bake for 35 minutes before checking for doneness with a wooden skewer. (When inserted halfway between the inner and outer wall, the skewer should come out dry).

 Ingredients: 
 4 cups plus 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup sugar, plus additional for sprinkling 
 2 tablespoons baking powder 
 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1 tablespoon grated orange zest 
 3/4 pound cold unsalted butter, diced 
 4 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 
 1 cup cold heavy cream 
 1 cup dried cranberries 
 1 egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water or milk, for egg wash 
 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 
 4 teaspoons freshly squeezed orange juice 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix 4 cups of flour, 1/4 cup sugar, the baking powder, salt and orange zest. Add the cold butter and mix at the lowest speed until the butter is the size of peas. Combine the eggs and heavy cream and, with the mixer on low speed, slowly pour into the flour and butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough will look lumpy! Combine the dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of flour, add to the dough, and mix on low speed until blended. Dump the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead it into a ball. Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough 3/4-inch thick. You should see small bits of butter in the dough. Keep moving the dough on the floured board so it doesn't stick. Flour a 3-inch round plain or fluted cutter and cut circles of dough. Place the scones on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Collect the scraps neatly, roll them out, and cut more circles. Brush the tops of the scones with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are browned and the insides are fully baked. The scones will be firm to the touch. Allow the scones to cool for 15 minutes and then whisk together the confectioners' sugar and orange juice, and drizzle over the scones. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

Once the butter has melted, add the Brussels sprouts, salt and pepper and cook, stirring continually, until the color brightens and the sprouts are just tender, approximately 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add the cranberries, toss and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the ramekins 
 2 tablespoons sugar, plus more for the ramekins 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1 cup milk, warmed 
 5 eggs, separated 
 Pinch salt 
 Ground white pepper 
 Pinch ground nutmeg 
 1 cup crumbled blue cheese 
 Pinch cream of tartar 
 8 fresh black mission figs, split in 1/2 lengthwise 
 1/2 cup honey 
 Confectioners' sugar, for dusting 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins by greasing them with softened butter and then coating them with sugar, tapping out any excess. Make a thick bechamel sauce base by melting the 3 tablespoons of butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed pot. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour with fat and remove the starchy taste; do not allow the roux to brown. Add the warm milk to the mixture and continue to whisk until smooth and thick. Remove from the heat. Beat in the egg yolks 1 at a time. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the cheese until incorporated evenly. Chill the mixture while whipping the egg whites. In a separate clean bowl beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the bechamel mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a cookie sheet. Bake on the middle rack for about 25 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden, and the center jiggles slightly. Serve with fresh figs and a drizzle of honey. Dust with confectioners' sugar. <|endoftext|>

Make a well in the middle of the veggies, add the olive oil, and cook for 1 minute, then add the ham hocks. Cook the ham hocks, turning every 2 minutes, until all sides are warm and starting to lightly brown. Add the chicken stock and the peas. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in freshly cracked pepper, to taste, and remove the ham hocks from the pot to a cutting board. Let them cool for a few minutes and with a fork, shred the meat and add to the soup. Stir in the heavy cream and the vinegar. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and serve with the goat cheese croutons. Sprinkle with rendered pancetta and a crack of black pepper and serve. Combine all the ingredients, except the panko, in a small bowl. Form into a log shape and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for 30 minutes or until firm. While in freezer, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the cheese from the freezer and slice into 1/4-inch rounds. Flatten each slice with your palm or hand, and press into the panko crumbs. Arrange on a silicone baking mat or parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes, then turn over and continue to bake for 6 to 8 minutes more. Cool and store in airtight container in the refrigerator. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms 
 1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms 
 1 bay leaf 
 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half 
 3 black peppercorns 
 Kosher salt 
 1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as oyster and cremini) 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 
 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
 8 ounces butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced 
 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped 
 2 cups arborio rice 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 1/2 cup grated aged gouda or parmesan cheese, plus shaved cheese for serving 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 
 Instructions: 
 Soak the porcinis in 5 cups hot water, 30 minutes. Strain into a saucepan, squeezing the liquid from the porcinis; chop the porcinis and set aside. Make the mushroom broth: Remove the shiitake stems and transfer to a separate saucepan. Add 5 cups water, the bay leaf, 1/2 cinnamon stick, the peppercorns and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook 3 minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside to infuse, 30 minutes. Strain into the saucepan with the porcini soaking liquid, squeezing the liquid from the shiitake stems; discard the solids. Meanwhile, chop the shiitake mushroom caps and mixed mushrooms. Heat 3 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in an extra-large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and the remaining 1/2 cinnamon stick and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the shiitake caps and mixed mushrooms in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft, about 3 more minutes. Season with salt and discard the cinnamon stick. Bring the mushroom broth to a simmer. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 
 Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 1/4 cup olive oil, divided 
 24 sea scallops 
 Field greens 
 Warm Bacon Vinaigrette, recipe follows 
 2 cups diced bacon, about 12 slices or a standard package 
 2 1/2 ounces shallot, minced 
 1/2-ounce garlic, minced 
 1 cup brown sugar 
 3/4 cup cider vinegar 
 1 1/2 cups olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 In a shallow dish combine the flour, seafood seasoning, sea salt and cracked black pepper, to taste. Coat a large saute pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil and put over high heat. Dredge half of the scallops in the flour mixture, making sure to coat completely. Add to the hot oil, and quickly sear, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and continue to sear for another 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to rest for 2 minutes. Repeat procedure with the remaining scallops. Meanwhile, arrange a small amount of field greens in the middle of each serving plate. Arrange 4 prepared scallops on the greens and sprinkle with the warm bacon vinaigrette before serving. In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the bacon and render until brown and crisp. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain and cool. Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat. Add the shallots and garlic to the bacon fat and saute for a minute. Add the brown sugar and stir until melted and incorporated. Remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar and oil. Blend with immersion blender until smooth and season with salt and pepper, to taste. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 cups warm water 
 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast 
 4 cups flour (approximately): unbleached all-purpose or hard white flour, or a 50-50 blend of white and whole wheat 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 tablespoons olive oil (approximately) 
 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
 Leaves from 3 sprigs rosemary (approximately 2 tablespoons) 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: large bread bowl, 12 by 18-inch baking sheet or two smaller sheets Place water in a large bowl. Water should be warm but not hot to the touch. Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve. Stir in 1 cup flour, stirring constantly in the same direction. Stir in another cup flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This helps develop the gluten. You now have a sponge. Cover, and let stand for half an hour or up to three hours. When you are ready to continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become smooth and easy to work. Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise, covered with plastic wrap. Let rise until more than doubled, almost three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled, you can proceed to the next step. Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored. If you wish postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the bowl to rise again. If delay will be more than several hours, instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it.Lightly flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your baking sheet. Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it is resisting stretching. It will need to get quite thin. When you have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and stretch it to fit. Don't worry if it tears, just patch the hole with another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of the pizza). Brush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all over with your fingers. Sprinkle garlic, sea salt and then optional rosemary leaves. Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often made pizza bianca several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300 degree F oven for about 10 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Whipped cream and grated orange zest, for topping 
 For the filling: 
 8 large egg yolks 
 2/3 cup granulated sugar 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
 Finely grated zest of 2 oranges, plus juice of 4 oranges 
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 Pinch of salt 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 1 cup cold heavy cream 
 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 For the crepes: 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 3 large eggs 
 2 cups milk 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 Make the filling: Whisk the egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch, orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice and salt in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula until the mixture comes to a simmer and is thick like pudding, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until melted. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the filling and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the crepe batter: Combine the flour, eggs, milk, melted butter, granulated sugar, vanilla and salt in a blender; blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. Set aside, covered, 1 hour. (This prevents the crepes from turning out rubbery.) Finish the filling: Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until it starts thickening, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, about 1 more minute. Beat in the vanilla. Stir one-quarter of the whipped cream into the orange filling, then gently fold in the rest. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Make the crepes: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly brush with butter, then pour 1/4 cup batter into the center of the pan. Quickly tilt and swirl the pan to coat and cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top is firm, about 1 minute. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a spatula, then flip with your fingers; cook until lightly browned on the other side, 30 more seconds. Invert onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the crepes as you go; lightly brush the pan with more butter as needed. You will have about 16 crepes. (Don't worry if a few tear-layer them in the middle of your cake.) Put 1 crepe on a platter and top with a scant 1/4 cup filling, spreading it to the edge. Repeat, stacking the remaining crepes and filling, and ending with a crepe. Refrigerate overnight (this will make slicing easier). Top with whipped cream and orange zest before serving.

 Ingredients: 
 4 poblano chiles 
 2 jalapenos chiles 
 16 tomatillos, (about 1 pound) husked, rinsed, and quartered 
 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling tomatillos 
 1 (10-inch) whole wheat tortilla 
 Olive oil cooking spray 
 1 large onion, finely diced 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved 
 1 tablespoon ground cumin 
 Pinch paprika, plus extra for garnish 
 2 teaspoons sugar 
 2 tablespoons water 
 4 large eggs

 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roast the poblano and jalepeno chiles directly in the flame of a gas burner, turning until charred on all sides. (Alternatively, if cooking with an electric stove, broil until charred.) Put chiles in a bowl, cover and steam until soft and cool, about 20 minutes. Peel, seed, and chop. Spread the tomatillos on a foil-lined pan, season with salt, pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in the oven until soft and slightly charred, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut tortillas into wedges and lay out on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spray both sides with olive oil spray and bake until crisp and golden, turning half way in between, 8 minutes per side. Saute onions and garlic in 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil until soft and starting to brown, 8 minutes. Add peppers, tomatoes, cumin, paprika, sugar and water and cook until tomatoes begin to burst and flavors come together, 5 minutes. Divide sauce between 4 small dishes. Poach eggs and lay 1 egg on each plate over sauce. Garnish with a couple of baked tortillas, crumbled queso fresco, a pinch of paprika and chopped cilantro.

 Ingredients: 
 5 pounds elk or venison, use fairly good quality meat 
 1 cup soy sauce 
 1/2 cup lime juice 
 1/2 cup vinegar 
 1/4 cup crushed red chili flakes 
 2 tablespoons garlic powder 
 Instructions: 
 Slice meat against the grain approximately 3/16 to 1/4-inch thick. It works best if you slice the meat when it is partially frozen. In a bowl mix together soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, red chili flakes, and garlic powder. Add the meat to the cure and marinate for at least 24 hours, refrigerated. Rack the meat in a hot smoker and smoke at a low temperature, approximately 100 degrees F, for 1 to 2 days until almost crispy. Don't over dry or the jerky will be too crunchy. Store, well wrapped, in non-frost free freezer for up to 1 year. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Apple-Vanilla Muffins: 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 
 Large pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
 1/3 cup light brown sugar 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1 large egg 
 1/4 cup sour cream 
 1/2 small apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup) 
 Cider Glaze: 
 2 cups apple cider 
 1 small cinnamon stick 
 2 tablespoons honey 
 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar 
 Instructions: 
 For the apple-vanilla muffins: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and center an oven rack. Line a mini-muffin tray with your favorite liners. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Combine the sugar, butter and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Beat on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 4 minutes, scraping as needed. Add the egg and beat until incorporated (don't worry if the batter curdles). Adjust to medium-low speed and alternate adding the flour mixture and the sour cream in batches, beginning and ending with the flour. Fold in the apples using a spatula. Grease a small ice-cream scoop (about 1 1/4 inches) with nonstick spray and fill the liners about 3/4 of the way to the top. Bake, rotating halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the muffins comes out clean and the tops spring back when touched, 10 to 12 minutes. Let rest in the hot muffin pan for 3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. For the cider glaze: Boil the cider with the cinnamon stick over medium-high heat until the cider is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Whisk in the honey and continue to boil until the liquid is syrupy and just coats the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick and remove from the heat. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar and transfer to a small bowl. Let sit until slightly set but still warm, about 3 minutes. Dip the tops of the muffins in the glaze and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 cloves garlic, smashed 
 Pinch red chile flakes 
 3 Roma tomatoes, diced 
 4 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves chopped, some reserved for garnish 
 Kosher salt 
 1/4 cup white wine 
 1 1/2 pounds squid, cleaned, skin removed, bodies cut into 1/4-inch rings, tentacles reserved for another use 
 1 recipe Chef Anne's All-Purpose Pasta Dough with Squid Ink, see recipe, rolled into pasta sheets and hand cut into tagliatelle 
 Grated parm, for sprinkling 
 Big fat finishing oil, for drizzling 
 Instructions: 
 Add the olive oil, smashed garlic and red chile flakes to a large saute pan. Turn the heat to medium-high and allow the garlic to become fragrant and the oil heated. Once heated, add the tomatoes and oregano, and season with salt. Stir to combine. Cook until the tomatoes release their water, 2 to 3 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Cook until the wine is bubbling and has begun to reduce, about 1 minute. Add the squid, stir to combine, and cook until the squid becomes opaque in color--be careful not to overcook it! Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook for about 2 minutes. Remove the pasta from the water and add it directly to the sauce along with about 2 tablespoons of the pasta water, some more oregano, some grated parm and a drizzle of big fat finishing oil. Gently toss to combine. Plate and garnish with more grated parm. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Vegetable oil 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting pan 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 
 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 
 2 (2 1/2-ounce) jars sweet potato baby food (about 1/2 cup) 
 1/3 cup buttermilk 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 
 1 cup sugar 
 3 large eggs, at room temperature 
 Confectioners' sugar, for dusting 
 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 
 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar 
 1/3 cup thinly sliced (or chopped) crystallized ginger 
 1/4 cup caramel sauce 
 Ground cinnamon, for dusting, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease, then line a 13 by 18-inch jelly-roll pan with parchment or waxed paper. (Let the paper come up the long sides by about 2 inches - this will make it easier to form the roll.) Brush paper with oil or butter, dust with flour, tap out excess. Cake: Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, salt, ginger and cardamom together in a medium bowl. In another bowl, combine sweet potato, buttermilk, and vanilla until smooth. Beat butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce to low; add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the wet mixture in 2 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Beat until just blended. (If needed, fold batter together with a rubber spatula.) Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake until cake springs back when pressed lightly, about 15 minutes. Run knife around cake edge, and invert cake onto a cotton tea towel (100 percent cotton works best and keeps the cake from sticking) generously dusted with confectioners' sugar. Carefully pull back parchment paper to release, and then place it back on top of the cake. Gently roll up the cake and towel together, starting from the narrow end to make a fat roll. Meanwhile for the filling, whip cream and confectioner's sugar to soft peaks. Fold in crystallized ginger. Carefully unroll the cake and remove the towel. Drizzle caramel over the cake. Spread gingered cream evenly over the cake. Using the short edge of parchment as guide, roll the cake up into a fat, loose cylinder. Transfer to a long platter. Dust with more confectioners' sugar and cinnamon in a Halloween pattern if desired. Serve, now or refrigerate until ready to serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 1/4 teaspoon ajawain (optional) (available at South Asian or specialty spice markets) 
 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 
 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed 
 5 tablespoons cold water 
 4 russet potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 
 Kosher salt, as needed, plus 1 tablespoon 
 1/2 medium yellow onion 
 One 1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled 
 4 cloves garlic 
 1 serrano chile (with seeds), stemmed 
 3 tablespoons water 
 3 tablespoons ghee or oil, recipe follows 
 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds (available at South Asian or specialty spice markets) 
 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds 
 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds 
 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala (See Cook?s Note.) 
 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 
 1/2 cup cooked peas 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 Serving suggestion: Tamarind sauce or your favorite chutney 
 1 pound unsalted butter 
 Instructions: 
 Filling: To make the dough: Whisk together the flour, ajawain, if using, and the salt. Add the oil and, using your hands, rub it into the flour mixture until fully incorporated. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add the water, until a dough is formed. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until soft and pliable, about 3 minutes. Rub a little oil over the dough and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold tap water by about 2 inches, and season with salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. Using a fork, slightly smash the potatoes. Meanwhile, in a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the onion, ginger, garlic, chile, and 1 tablespoon water and puree to a paste. Heat the ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mustard, cumin, and fennel seeds and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion paste, salt, garam masala, and turmeric and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring and mashing lightly with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peas. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons water. To form the samosas: Divide the dough into 7 portions. Using your hands, roll each portion into a small ball. On a floured work surface, using rolling pin, roll each ball into a 7-inch wide disc. Cut each disc in half. Set a small bowl of water beside you. Working with one dough semi-circle at a time, fold half of the straight edge up to the rounded side and wet its outside edge with a little water. Fold the other half up to form a cone, overlapping it with the other side by 1/4 inch. Press the edges together to form a seal. Hold the cone in one hand and fill it with about 1/4 cup of the potato filling. Slightly wet the inside of the rounded edge and fold it over the filling to enclose it. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 14 samosas. There are two choices at this point. For samosas with a slightly blistered and bubbly crust, store them uncovered in the refrigerator overnight and fry them the next day (the dough becomes soft and moist, creating small puffs in the dough when fried); or continue to the next step and fry them right away for an equally good but smooth crust. In a large, wide heavy-bottomed pot, pour in the oil to a depth of about 2 inches. Place over medium heat, and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees F. Working in small batches, fry the samosas until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Serve immediately with tamarind sauce or your favorite chutney. Ghee: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until all of the water has evaporated and the white milk solids have browned in the bottom of the saucepan, about 8 minutes. Pour the ghee into a large container, leaving the browned milk solids in the pan. Use now or store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Yield: about 2 cups <|endoftext|>

Add it to the flour mixture and pulse until the mixture looks like wet sand. Mix just until the dough comes together. Don't overwork; the dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the peaches and cook gently until heated through, about 5 minutes. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls over the warm peaches. There can be gaps, the dough will puff up and spread out as it bakes. Brush the top with some heavy cream and sprinkle with some sugar; put it into the oven on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Cook for 40 to 45 minutes until the top is browned and the fruit is bubbling. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 pounds beef tenderloin 
 1/2 cup grated prepared horseradish 
 1 cup sour cream 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 
 1 pint grape tomatoes, halved 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 Watercress sprigs, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a large, heavy cast iron or ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add a 2-count drizzle of oil and get it smoking hot. Put the tenderloin in the skillet and sear the outside of the meat all over, 5 to 8 minutes total. Put it in the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes until rare (the internal temperature of the meat will be 120 degrees F). Take the meat out of the pan, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate until it gets until good and cold, 1 to 2 hours. While you wait for the beef to chill, stir the horseradish, sour cream, lemon juice and oil together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. When the beef is cold, take a long, very sharp knife, and cut the meat into slices as thin as you can make them. Lay them out on a platter (they'll overlap – that's fine). Now drizzle the horseradish sauce all over the meat. Hand crush the tomatoes in a bowl and add olive oil to make them saucy; season that with salt and pepper too so that it tastes really good. Drizzle the tomato mixture over the top and garnish the whole thing with watercress. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 poblano chile peppers 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 1 pound ground turkey (80/20 blend) 
 2 cups panko breadcrumbs 
 3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 1/2 cup diced onion 
 2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon cumin 
 1 tablespoon onion powder 
 1 teaspoon paprika 
 Kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper 
 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock 
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
 1 cup frozen corn, thawed 
 12 ounces penne rigate 
 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
 1 lime, zested 
 2 cups creme fraiche 
 4 ripe Roma tomatoes 
 1/4 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 Instructions: 
 Begin by charring the poblano chile peppers. Using tongs, place the peppers directly over an open flame on the stove top. Char all over, about 2 minutes per side, and then place in a bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap so they sweat. Leave to sit for 5 minutes, and then use a paper towel to remove the charred outer layer. Discard the stem and seeds, and then dice the peppers. Set a large Dutch oven over high heat and add the butter and olive oil. Add the turkey, onions and garlic and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the flour and season with the cumin, onion powder, paprika and some salt and pepper. The flour will form a roux with the fat in the pan. Cook for 2 minutes while stirring, and then add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the heavy cream and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and fold in diced chile peppers and corn. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente, about 12 minutes. Fold the pasta into the turkey sauce and season with salt and pepper, stirring until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. In a large mixing bowl, prepare the topping by combining the panko, Parmigiano-Reggiano, olive oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine everything well. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly on top of the pasta. Place the whole dish on a sheet tray (to catch any spill over) and place in the oven to bake until the breadcrumbs are golden and the sauce is bubbly around the edges, about 35 minutes. For garnishes, stir the lime zest together with creme fraiche. Dice the tomatoes and roughly chop the parsley. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Nonstick cooking spray 
 1 store-bought refrigerated pie crust 
 4 cups chopped pecans 
 1 cup honey 
 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 
 3 whole large eggs plus 3 yolks 
 1 cup stout beer or other dark beer 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 2 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
 Caramel Sauce, recipe follows 
 2 cups sugar 
 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a 9-inch springform pan and pastry brush Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Roll out the pie crust, place into the prepared pan and prick the bottom with a fork. Fill the crust with chopped pecans. Transfer to the refrigerator until the filling is done. In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, dark brown sugar, eggs and egg yolks until smooth. Whisk in the beer and allow the foam to settle. Stir the melted butter into the flour in a separate bowl until smooth and lump free. Whisk the butter mixture into the sugar filling until well combined. Remove the crust from the refrigerator and fill with the sugar mixture. Place the pie in the center of the oven and bake until the center is set, 50 to 55 minutes. It will still move a little but it won't roll in the pan. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving. Serve with the Caramel Sauce. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water. Add the lemon juice, and brush down the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush to remove any sugar crystals from the sides of the pot. Bring to a boil. When the sugar starts to turn brown, after about 7 minutes, slowly pour in the cream, whisking constantly. The sauce will bubble dramatically so be careful. When the cream is incorporated, return to a boil, stirring constantly. Once it has returned to a boil, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, stirring until melted. Serve immediately or cool completely and store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to one week. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Eight 4-ounce 1/4-inch-thick eye of round steaks, needled or pounded and tenderized 
 1 cup buttermilk 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 
 1 cup whole milk 
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
 2 teaspoons smashed brined peppercorns 
 1 teaspoon brining liquid from the peppercorns 
 2 dashes hot sauce 
 Kosher salt 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon kosher salt 
 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper 
 2 teaspoons garlic powder 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 1 teaspoon onion powder 
 Vegetable oil, for frying 
 Instructions: 
 For the marinade: Soak the tenderized steaks in the buttermilk for 1 hour or up to overnight. This will help tenderize the meat. For the spiced milk gravy: Like any good gravy, we are starting out with a simple roux of equal parts butter and flour. Melt the butter in a medium saucepot over medium heat, then whisk in the flour. Cook the flour and butter until it's a light blond color (just enough to cook the raw taste out), about 2 minutes, and then whisk in the broth and milk. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the Worcestershire sauce, peppercorns, brine, hot sauce and salt to taste and bring back to a simmer. Check for seasoning and set aside until ready to use. For the chicken-fried steaks: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Add the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, baking soda, cayenne and onion powder to a shallow baking dish. Remove the steaks from the buttermilk and place each steak in the flour mixture, coating all of the sides and shaking off the excess. Next, dip the steaks back into the buttermilk, coating them on all sides and allowing the excess to drip off. Return to the flour mixture once again, shaking off the excess. Reserve the flour mixture for dredging the steak a third time for an extra-crispy crust after resting. Let the steaks sit on a wire rack in the fridge 30 minutes (this will help the coating to really adhere to the chicken-fried steak). Then re-dredge in the seasoned flour just before frying. Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Working in batches of two at a time, place the steaks in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, using tongs to turn once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat the process with all the steaks. Transfer the chicken-fried steaks to individual plates. Spoon the Spiced Milk Gravy over the steak and serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 to 4 tablespoons butter 
 1 1/4 cups brown sugar (light brown preferred) 
 2 cups rich milk, light cream, or half milk and half evaporated milk 
 3 eggs 
 7 tablespoons flour 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
 2 cups flour 
 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, frozen, cut into small pieces 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 2 eggs 
 3 eggs 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 Instructions: 
 In a saucepan melt butter and add brown sugar. Stir until the mixture bubbles up and looks slightly browner. Add milk to sugar stir to combine well. Whisk in egg yolks with flour and salt. Stir in remaining milk to mixture. When the sugar mixture becomes hot, slowly stir in the egg and flour mixture. Cook over medium heat until the pudding boils up. Turn the heat very low and stir and cook 1 or 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour cooled butterscotch into pre-baked piecrust. Top the pie with meringue. Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven 15 to 18 minutes until lightly browned. For the Crumb Crust: Put the metal chopping blade in place in the food processor beaker. Add the flour, frozen butter, and salt to the beaker. Process for 8 to 10 seconds, turning on and off, until the butter is cut into the flour and the mixture forms very small, flaky granules. Add the lemon juice and eggs to the beaker and process until a ball of dough forms on top of the blades, about 15 seconds. The dough should be damp but not sticky. If it seems too soft, sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons flour and process for an additional 5 to 6 seconds, until well combined. If it feels too dry, sprinkle with a few drops of water and process to blend well. Wrap the ball of dough in waxed paper, plastic wrap, or foil and chill until firm but still malleable. For the Meringue: Whip egg whites together with sugar until the peaks are soft. Rolling out the pastry. When the pastry is chilled and firm but still malleable, it is ready to be rolled out. Roll out on a cool surface as possible; a marble slab is ideal. Baking Shell -Blind Baking: Lay the roll out pastry dough into the pan, and line the shell with foil or waxed paper, weight it down with raw rice or beans and bake it in a preheated 425 degree oven for 14 to 16 minutes, until the bottom is set and the edges lightly browned. After the initial baking, remove the shell from the oven, remove the lining and brush the bottom with beaten egg yolk, and return to the oven for 2 minutes. This seals the bottom and prevents a soggy crust. Top the pie with the meringue and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the meringue is lightly brown. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Unsalted butter for greasing pan, at room temperature 
 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note) 
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 
 4 large eggs, at room temperature 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 1/2 cup finely grated carrot, from 1 medium carrot with top, fronds reserved 
 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, plus extra for dusting 
 1 cup finely grated carrot, from 2 medium carrots with greens 
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
 Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 
 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 Pinch of fine salt 
 2 cups confectioners' sugar 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 1 to 2 teaspoons milk 
 Orange gel food coloring 
 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 
 1/4 cup raisins 
 1/4 cup golden raisins 
 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: small offset spatula, orange gel food coloring, pastry bag and plain pastry tip Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the cake: Grease a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan with butter, line bottom of the pan with parchment paper and generously butter and flour the paper. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, and salt and stir to combine. Place the eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light, thick and pale, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low, add the carrot, then slowly add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until the top springs back when gently touched, about 15 minutes. While the cake is baking, lay a clean, thin cotton dish towel out on a flat surface and sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over it. (This will prevent the cake from sticking to the towel.) As soon as you remove the cake from the oven, loosen it around the edges and invert it squarely onto the prepared towel. Peel away the parchment paper. Starting at one of the short ends, gently roll the warm cake and the towel together. Allow the rolled cake to cool completely on a wire rack. For the candied carrots: Combine the grated carrot, sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often, and cook until the carrots are bright orange, glossy and almost dry, about 12 minutes. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon and let cool. (The candied carrots will be in clumps.) For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese, butter and salt together with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined and smooth, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners¿ sugar, vanilla and 1 teaspoon milk. Continue to beat until completely combined, about 2 minutes. (If needed add the second teaspoon of milk, the mixture should be fluffy not runny.) Increase the speed to high and beat until fluffy, about 4 minutes more. To assemble: Place 1/2 cup of the frosting in a small bowl and set aside. Carefully unroll the cake onto a cutting board with the towel underneath. Using a small offset spatula, spread half the frosting evenly over the cake. Sprinkle the frosting evenly with walnuts, raisins and golden raisins, making sure to go all the way to the edges. Disperse teaspoons of candied carrots across the frosting. Carefully reroll the cake, using the towel as a guide. Place the cake roll on a platter. Frost the sides and ends of the cake with the remaining frosting and press shredded coconut all over the surface. Combine the reserved 1/2 cup frosting with 2 to 4 drops orange food coloring and mix well. Transfer the tinted frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe 12 carrots evenly down the center of the cake roll and top each with a small piece of reserved carrot frond. Place the cake in the refrigerator until fully chilled, about 2 hours. <|endoftext|>

 2 tablespoons premium fruit pectin, such as Sure-Jell 
 1 1/4 cup sugar 
 5 egg whites 
 1/2 vanilla bean, seeded 
 Dash of salt 
 1 pound butter, at room temperature (slightly moist on the outside but cold inside) 
 2 tablespoons vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup port wine 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place 24 cupcake liners in cupcake pans. In an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar for 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and then add the eggs one at a time. Add the almond extract and food coloring. In a separate bowl, combine the absinthe and heavy whipping cream. In another bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt. Turn the mixer to the lowest setting, and then add the almond meal, flour mixture and absinthe mixture, alternating the ingredients, starting with the dry and ending with the dry. Scrape down the bowl to make sure all the ingredients are fully combined. Add the currants, cherries and poppy seeds, and fold by hand into the batter. Fill the cupcake liners with 2 1/2 ounces of cupcake batter. Bake for 21 minutes. After cooling, frost with the Port Wine Black Currant Swiss Merengue Buttercream. This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition. The Food Network Kitchens have not tested it for home use, therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results. For the black currant preserves: Combine and dissolve the currants, grape juice, sugar and pectin in saucepan. Cook on medium to high heat, stirring constantly. When the mixture reaches a boil, continue to cook for 2 minutes. Cool in the refrigerator. For the buttercream: Dissolve the sugar, egg whites, salt and vanilla bean seeds over a double boiler. Lightly whisk until the egg white mixture is hot to the touch. Pour the hot whites into a room-temperature mixing bowl and whip with a whisk attachment on high until stiff peaks form and the mixture is double in volume. Cut the butter into 2-inch pieces. Change to a paddle attachment and slowly add a few pieces of butter at a time. Continue beating until the mixture begins to look light and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl. Reduce the speed to low. Add the vanilla extract and continue to beat on LOW speed for 45 seconds. Once thoroughly combined, slowly add the port wine and 1/2 cup black current preserves, and then beat on medium to high speed until all ingredients are fully combined, an additional 45 to 60 seconds. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 small red onion, cut in half and thinly sliced 
 5 whole ripe fresh limes (cut 1 lime into 4 wedges) 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 quarts grape seed or corn oil 
 1 pound boneless and skinless chicken thighs 
 2 1/4 tablespoons adobo powder, such as Goya or similar seasoning 
 2 egg whites 
 2 1/2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika 
 1/4 cup fine-ground yellow cornmeal 
 3/4 cup fine wholewheat flour 
 4 cups 2-inch square chunks iceberg lettuce 
 16 cherry tomatoes, stems removed and washed 
 1/2 ripe Hass avocado, peeled and cut into 8 chunks 
 1 bunch cilantro 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: a deep fry thermometer Place the sliced red onions in a small stainless steel bowl. With a fine grater or zester, zest the skin of 1 lime over the onions. Cut the 4 whole limes in half cross wise and squeeze the juice over the onions. Add a pinch of salt and mix. Submerge the onions in the juice; use the squeezed limes as a weight to push down any onions sticking out of the juice. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. Marinate the onions in the juice for as long as possible, at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days. Pour the oil into a large heavy pot that has at least a 6-quart capacity. (There should be at least 2 inches of oil in the pot.) Clip a deep-frying thermometer to the side of the pot and be sure the thermometer is touching the bottom of the pot. Heat the oil to 400 degrees F over medium heat (do not ever cover the pot). Place a chicken thigh on a cutting board and cut into 4 to 5 even-sized chunks. Repeat until all thighs are cut into chunks. Arrange all the chunks on a microwave-safe plate and season both sides with 1/4 tablespoon of adobo powder, as well as pepper. Place the plate in the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Remove the plate and turn each piece of chicken over. Microwave again on high until the chunks are just cooked through, another 1 to 2 minutes, depending on your microwave. Let the chicken cool to room temperature. Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat with a fork until just foamy, about 1 minute. In a separate wide and shallow bowl or cake pan, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of adobo powder and paprika with the cornmeal and whole-wheat flour. Mix thoroughly. Submerge the chicken pieces in the egg whites. With a fork, toss to coat. One at a time, lift the chicken pieces from the egg whites, transfer them to the flour mixture, and coat each piece thoroughly. Let the chicken sit in one layer over the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly prior to assembling the salad. Place the iceberg chunks in a bowl and add the cherry tomatoes. Drain the lime juice from the onions and reserve. To the salad, add the onions, a dash of salt, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved lime juice. Toss to dress evenly. Divide the salad among four serving plates. Divide the avocado pieces equally among the salads. Fry the chicken in the oil in four separate batches until deep golden brown, about 12 seconds. Using metal tongs or a stainless steel spider basket, remove the chicken pieces from the oil and transfer them to a plate with either a wire rack on top or paper towels to drain off any excess oil. (Turn the stove off immediately after your last batch.) Arrange the cooked chicken evenly around the individual salads. Place 4 cilantro sprigs over each salad. Serve with lime wedges. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 
 1 ounce fresh cilantro, finely chopped 
 2 large shallots, finely chopped 
 1 clove garlic, minced 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Tomato and Pepper Coulis: 
 4 tablespoons olive oil 
 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 
 3 shallots, peeled 
 2 cloves garlic 
 2 whole red peppers, roasted 
 2 tomatoes, halved 
 1 small bunch fresh cilantro 
 Salt and ground white pepper 
 Crab Cakes: 
 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 
 1 cup mayonnaise 
 1 ounce fresh cilantro, chopped 
 1 egg 
 1 small red onion, cut into small dice 
 1 green pepper, cut into small dice 
 1 red pepper, cut into small dice 
 1 yellow pepper, cut into small dice 
 1 pound jumbo lump crab meat 
 Canola oil, for frying 
 Instructions: 
 For the corn relish: Add the milk and 2 cups water to a 3- to 4-quart pot and bring to a simmer. When it's at a simmer, stir in the butter, salt and sugar; give it a few minutes until the butter has melted. Place the corn in the pot, cover and cook until tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the corn and cool down enough to handle, and then cut off the kernels with a knife. (Hint: it will be easier to remove the kernels off the cob if still warm.) Mix together the corn, vinegar, cilantro, shallots, garlic and salt and black pepper to taste in a large bowl. For the coulis: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. As that is working, mix together the oil, vinegar, shallots, garlic, peppers, tomatoes, cilantro and some salt and white pepper in a large bowl. Make sure to coat the ingredients evenly with the oil. Place on a baking sheet and roast for about 20 minutes, and then transfer to a blender and mix until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh strainer. Set aside. For the crab cakes: Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F. Mix together the breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, cilantro, egg, onions and peppers in a large bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes while you open and drain the crabmeat. Once the crab is drained of all excess liquid, fold it into the breadcrumb mixture. Form into 8 equal crab cakes. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a saute pan, and then sear the crab cakes until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to the oven to for 10 minutes. To plate this dish, we use an 8-inch round white plate. First, place a small amount of the corn relish in the center. Place the browned crab cakes directly onto the corn. Finally, spoon a few ounces of the coulis around the corn and serve. <|endoftext|>

Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan and cook until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F, about 6 minutes. Stir in the walnuts and cook until the mixture becomes golden-brown and reaches 300 degrees F, about 5 more minutes. Remove the saucepan from heat, and stir in 1 stick butter, the vanilla extract, baking soda and salt¿the mixture will come to a vigorous bubble, then it will settle. Stir until the butter is fully melted and pour onto the silicone baking mat. Let the brittle cool completely, about 30 minutes. Break apart before serving. To assemble the parfaits: Add a large spoonful of jam to each parfait glass, then a scoop of Frozen Yogurt, and top with a few pieces of Homemade Walnut Brittle. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut in 2-inch cubes 
 Salt 
 4 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons EVOO (extra-virgin olive oil) 
 1 head of broccoli, trimmed and cut into florets and 1-inch cubes 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1 cup chicken stock 
 1 1/2 cups milk or half-and-half 
 1 1/2 cups shredded Gouda cheese 
 Instructions: 
 Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, salt the water, reduce the heat a bit, and cook until tender, about 12 minutes. Heads up: about halfway through you will add the broccoli to the pot, so use a pot large enough to accommodate both. Season the chicken breasts with the thyme, salt, and pepper. Heat the EVOO in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken for 6 minutes on each side. Add the broccoli to the potatoes and cook for 6 minutes. Heat the butter in a small saucepot over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the chicken stock and 1 cup of the milk or half-and-half. Thicken for 2 to 3 minutes, season the sauce with salt and pepper, then stir in the cheese in a figure-eight motion with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Turn off the heat. Drain the cooked broccoli and potatoes and return to the hot pot to dry them out. Mash the broccoli and potatoes together, using the remaining milk to reach the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken breasts on an angle. Pile some mashed broc-o-tatoes on plates and arrange the fanned-out chicken on the edge of the mound. Pour the Gouda gravy over the top. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 
 1/2 cup frozen corn (do not thaw) 
 1/4 cup instant oatmeal 
 One 1.25-ounce packet taco seasoning mix 
 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 egg, beaten 
 4 to 6 tablespoons olive oil 
 1 stick butter, at room temperature, cut into 4 pieces 
 3 egg yolks, beaten until they lighten in color 
 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
 Kosher salt 
 6 ounces deli ham, sliced paper thin (if you go to the counter) 
 4 poached or sunny-side up eggs 
 1/4 cup chopped dill pickles 
 1/4 cup lightly chopped fresh cilantro 
 2 Roma or plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped 
 Instructions: 
 For the black bean patties: Mash the beans in a large bowl, leaving some of the bean texture. Stir in the corn, oatmeal, taco seasoning and garlic. Stir to combine, taste and then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Fold in the egg. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 15 minutes to hydrate the oats. In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil on medium heat. When the oil begins to swirl a bit, use an ice cream scoop to portion the black bean mixture equally into 4 balls. Drop them into the pan, then press each into a patty shape with a spatula. Cook on one side until golden and a bit crisp, about 8 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until slightly crisped, 5 to 8 minutes more. Remove to individual serving plates. For the cream sauce: In a double boiler with the water boiling but not touching the pot above, add a piece of the butter, the yolks, lime juice, a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Whisk continuously while the butter melts, then add another piece of butter, working it in until it melts. Continue adding the butter pieces one at a time, whisking and melting between additions, until all the pieces are whisked in. Taste and adjust with salt if needed. Keep warm on the double boiler. Divide the ham into 4 servings and place a portion on top of each black bean patty. Top each with an egg, drizzle over the sauce and sprinkle with pickles. Sprinkle the plate with cilantro and tomatoes. Serve warm. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 3/4- to 5-pound brisket, trimmed but not completely fat free 
 1 head garlic, top 1/4-inch sliced off 
 4 teaspoons olive oil 
 3 small onions (about 12 ounces total), peeled, root end kept intact, cut in half lengthwise, each half cut into 3 wedges 
 1 pound carrots, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 3- to 4-inch pieces 
 1/2 cup water 
 2 cups drained and mushed whole plum tomatoes, plus 1/4 cup reserved roasting liquid or one 16-ounce can whole tomatoes with liquid 
 1 small bay leaf 
 Kosher salt, to taste 
 Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Place one rack in the center of the oven and another in the bottom. Heat oven to 500 degrees F. Place brisket, fat side down, in a 14 x12 x 2-inch roasting pan. It's best not to use a shallow pan for this, or later the juices might run over and out. Put the garlic in the pan. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Using your hands, rub oil onto garlic. Put the onion wedges and carrots into a smaller, 12 x 8 x 1 1/2-inch roasting pan. Drizzle with remaining oil. Using your hands, rub oil over all the pieces until they are well coated. Arrange onion wedges on their sides, so that they touch carrots as little as possible. Roast vegetables on center rack of oven for 30 minutes. Turn with a spatula. Roast 15 minutes more. Roast the brisket simultaneously on the bottom rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn over so fat side is up. Roast 30 minutes more. Remove both pans from oven. Lower heat to 275 degrees F, leaving the door ajar a minute or two to reduce temperature more quickly. Leave the brisket and garlic in the large pan and add 1/4 cup of the water. The water should bubble up from the heat of the pan; if it does not, put pan on the stove over medium-high heat. With a wooden spoon, scrape around the brisket to scoop up and remove the brown bits from the bottom of pan. Put the onions and carrots into the brisket pan. Put the smaller pan on top of the stove. Add the remaining water and bring contents to a boil while scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Pour liquid into brisket pan. Add roasted plum tomatoes and reserved roasting liquid or, if using canned tomatoes, stick a small knife into the opened can of tomatoes. Run it back and forth through the tomatoes and puree until only small pieces remain. Pour contents over vegetables and around brisket. Put the bay leaf into the liquid. Cover tightly with foil. Roast on center rack of oven for 3 1/2 hours. Remove foil, increase temperature to 500 degrees F, and roast 15 minutes more or until brisket is nicely browned. Remove. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. With the back of a spoon, smush the softened garlic out of each section and into the liquid. Throw the empty papers away. Transfer brisket to a platter and cover brisket with a tent of foil. Use slotted spoon to transfer vegetables to a large serving bowl or plate. Discard the bay leaf. Pour remaining liquid into a measuring cup. Let sit long enough for the fat to rise to the surface, about 15 minutes. Skim fat off surface. To serve, cut brisket against the grain into long thin strips. Arrange 2 to 3 slices on each plate. Spoon on some of the vegetables, and moisten everything with a generous amount of the liquid. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate discs 
 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 2 large eggs 
 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
 2 tablespoons sour cream 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1 large egg 
 Pink food coloring 
 3 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as desired 
 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 Milk, optional 
 Candies or cookies for decorating, such as pirouette cookies, white, pink or chocolate curls, dragees, edible glitter, chocolate cigars or wafer cookies 
 Instructions: 
 For the brownies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a mini-muffin pan with paper liners. Melt the butter, oil and chocolate discs together over a double boiler, stirring until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour with the cocoa powder, salt and baking soda. Stir the brown and granulated sugars and vanilla into the chocolate mixture with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and beat vigorously until fully incorporated and the batter is thick and glossy. Fold in the dry ingredients until just incorporated. Spoon the brownie batter into the cupcake liners, coming about three-quarters of the way up the sides. Set aside. For the cheesecake topping: Using an electric mixer, beat together the cream cheese with the granulated sugar, sour cream, vanilla and egg until well incorporated. Put half of the cheesecake topping into a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag. Use a bit of pink food coloring to dye the remaining topping; place into a second pastry bag. Snip the tips of the pastry bags and pipe 3 to 4 medium dots of each color on top of the brownie batter. Use a toothpick to gently swirl the cheesecake batter and cover the brownie batter completely. Bake for about 15 minutes, then cool completely. For the buttercream frosting: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high until smooth and light, about 1 minute. Add all but 1/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and mix on low just to combine. Add the vanilla and increase the speed to high; beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. (Add more confectioners' sugar or a bit of milk depending on how stiff or loose you want the frosting.) Remove the brownies from the pan and decorate with the buttercream frosting and candy or cookies as desired. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons finely ground pecans 
 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 Pinch salt 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small chunks 
 1 egg white, chilled 
 2 tablespoons ice water, only if needed 
 1 cup pecan halves 
 2 eggs 
 1/4 cup light brown sugar 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1/4 stick unsalted butter, melted 
 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1/4 cup dark corn syrup 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 6 earl grey tea bags 
 2 cups water 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 1 quart vanilla bean ice cream 
 Instructions: 
 In a food processor combine the ground pecans, flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the egg white and blend it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount of dough together, if it is crumbly, add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Lightly coat a 12-cup muffin tray with nonstick spray. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 2 foot square, then use a small bowl 3-inches in diameter or a large 3-inch ring mold as a guide to cut out circles. They should be slightly larger in diameter than the muffin tin hole, so when pressed in, the edges come half-way up the sides of the tin. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the eggs until frothy then blend in sugars. Stir in the melted butter, vanilla, syrup and salt until well blended. Arrange the pecans on the bottoms of the tart shells. Pour in the filling to fill the shells almost to the top. Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you're good to go. Transfer the pies to a rack and cool. While the pie is baking, make the Sweet Tea Caramel Sauce. Begin my making the tea. Bring 2 cups of cold water to a boil in a large heavy saucepan. Add the tea bags, cover and let steep for 20 minutes. Remove the tea bags (squeeze them out) and then return to a simmer until it has reduced by half - so you have 1 cup of really strong tea remaining. Add the 1/2 cup of sugar to the saucepan and continue to simmer over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pot around, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and looks like syrup, about 10 minutes. Carefully pour in the cream, be careful as it will bubble up, and continue to cook for 1 more minute. Serve with individual pecan pies and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. <|endoftext|>

 Salt and pepper, to taste 
 1 teaspoon beef bouillon powder or 1/2 cup liquid beef bouillon, or to taste 
 2 tablespoons vermouth 
 Instructions: 
 TO PREPARE THE PORK LOIN: In a pressure cooker on high heat, brown pork in oil on all sides to sear in juices. Season with salt and pepper. Then add water or broth to pan (enough so there's about 1 1/2 inches in the bottom of the cooker). The amount of liquid depends on the size of your roast-for 3 pounds use 1 1/2 inches of liquid -- add 1/2-inch more per each pound. Pressure cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours so pork is extremely tender and falls apart. (This is important to the dish). When pork is done, remove from pot and keep the meat juice to serve on pork and dumplings. Prep time on this is about 15 minutes to get a good, rich searing. Pressure cooking time is about 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on how tender you want your meat. Oven method: Pierce pork with a knife, slice 3 cloves of garlic and insert in different spots of roast. Season with salt and pepper. In a heavy cast iron pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and on high heat, brown pork to sear in juices. Add 2 cups beef broth and 1/4 cup vermouth (this will also deglaze the pan) and cover the pot with lid. Place in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, and frequently baste with pan juices. Be sure to periodically check your roast, as you want the roast to be pink and juicy inside, not dry and gray. After the pork is done, remove from pan and save the meat juices Combine 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water. Slowly add cornstarch mixture to thicken the juices for passing and to serve over pork and dumplings. This gives the juices a richer, heartier flavor that sticks to the pork and dumplings, unlike the traditional thinner juices to pass; however, Grandma and Grandpa always preferred the traditional thinner juice. Prep time on this is again, about 15 minutes to get a good searing, and cooking time anywhere from 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. While your meat is cooking, you can prepare the dumplings. POTATO DUMPLINGS: Combine dumpling ingredients well. Put out on floured bread board and knead more flour in until stiff-like bread dough and it isn't sticky to your hands. Break off small pieces and form into flat balls, drop into rapidly boiling water. Bring back to a boil and cook 10 to 15 minutes. Cut 1 and if it isn't sticky inside, they are done. NOTE: If you have more people - say 8 - mix potatoes for 8 and add more flour; for 10 or more, add 3 eggs and more flour. Prep time--10 to 20 minutes depending on how much kneading you have to do to get the dough not sticky. Cooking time - about 20 to 25 minutes or until the dumplings aren't doughy and sticky on the inside. SAUERKRAUT: In a heavy bottomed pot, heat olive oil and then add onion; cook until transparent. Then add sauerkraut and caraway seed, salt (not much) pepper, beef bouillon, and vermouth, to taste. Let this simmer for about 30 to 45 minutes, until the flavor is all the way through the sauerkraut. Serve along side the pork. Prep time about 10 minutes. Cooking time about 45 minutes or until you taste the flavor through the sauerkraut. To serve, which was usually done homestyle, you place some pork, a dumpling (cut it up into hearty, bit size pieces), and some sauerkraut on the plate. Then pass, and spoon or drizzle some of the meat juices you saved, either thick or thin, over your pork and dumpling....this ties everything all together, and you get a forkful of flavor in each bite. There you have it, hearty, stick to your ribs pork, dumplings and sauerkraut; an excellent dish on a cold, frosty night! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 
 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, well shaken 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 2 cups sugar 
 3 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten 
 One 3-ounce box strawberry gelatin 
 2 pounds strawberries 
 3 tablespoons sugar 
 2 cups heavy cream, cold 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 For the cake: Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch pan. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the buttermilk and vanilla in a spouted measuring cup; set aside. Beat the sugar and butter in a stand mixer (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) at medium speed until very light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Slowly add the eggs and beat until fully incorporated. Reduce the speed to the lowest setting; with the mixer running, alternate beating in the flour mixture in three additions and the buttermilk mixture in two, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Scrape down the side of the bowl, and beat until the batter is well mixed. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake the cake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Let cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Using a fork, poke holes in the top and all the way through the cake. Bring 1 cup water to a boil, pour over the gelatin in a small bowl and stir until completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup cold water. Pour the mixture evenly over the cooled cake. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Put a large bowl (for whipping the cream) in the refrigerator. For the sweetened berries: While the cake chills, hull and quarter the strawberries. Toss with the granulated sugar in a medium bowl, and set aside until soft and juicy, about 1 hour. For the topping: Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla in the chilled bowl until fluffy. Spread it over the cake, slice the cake and serve with the strawberries. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 king crab legs, meat removed 
 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
 1 bunch chives, finely chopped 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 One 1 1/4-pound beef tenderloin, trimmed of silver skin 
 6 to 8 thin asparagus, ends trimmed 
 Canola oil, for searing 
 Kosher salt 
 8 ounces Yukon gold potatoes 
 Canola oil, for frying 
 1/2 bunch rosemary 
 Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup champagne vinegar 
 1/4 cup dry white wine 
 2 medium shallots, minced 
 1 bay leaf 
 1 bunch tarragon 
 3 egg yolks 
 1 stick butter, melted 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 For the beef: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Chop the crabmeat and place in a bowl. Add the mayonnaise and chives, and mix to combine. Season with salt, pepper and the lemon juice. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Make a shallow cut lengthwise into the beef and then continue cutting along the curve, until the beef is a flat sheet. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Spread the crab mixture in an even layer on the beef, then place the asparagus lengthwise over the crab with the tips poking out. Roll up the beef to make a pinwheel, then use butchers twine to tie it together in 1-inch increments. Heat an ovenproof saute pan over high heat and add some oil. Sear the beef on all sides, then transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the internal temperature hits 130 degrees F, 30 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan and rest on a cutting board before slicing. For the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a saucepan filled with cool salted water. Cook the potatoes until tender, then drain and cool. Using your thumb or a spoon, smash the potatoes until they break apart slightly. In a straight-sided saute pan add enough oil to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer reads 365 degrees F. Add the rosemary and fry until crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Fry the potatoes until golden brown and crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with the flaky sea salt and pepper, and garnish with the fried rosemary. For the bearnaise: In a small saucepan set over medium-high heat, combine the vinegar, wine, shallots, bay leaf and half of the tarragon. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Pour through a fine mesh sieve to strain out the solids. In the pitcher of a blender, add the yolks and the vinegar reduction. With the blender running, add one-third of the butter in a slow, steady stream. Once it emulsifies, increase the blender speed to high and add the remaining butter. Add the remaining tarragon leaves, then season with salt and pepper and give it one more buzz. Set aside in a warm spot to hold the sauce. Slice the beef into two portions and serve with the potatoes and bearnaise sauce. <|endoftext|>

 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, add the grits, 1/2 cup of the Cheddar, 2 tablespoons of the butter and a few grinds of black pepper to a 2-quart casserole dish. Pour in the simmering water, and whisk until there are no lumps. Toss the shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bread and a pinch of salt to the butter, toss quickly to coat, then transfer to a small bowl; set aside. Wipe out the skillet, and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the scallions (reserve 1 tablespoon for garnish), andouille, celery, bell pepper and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the celery and bell pepper soften, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, stir for 1 minute, then add the chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. Scrape up the flavorful bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. The mixture should come to a simmer quickly, then remove from the heat and stir in the shrimp. Immediately spread the shrimp mixture evenly over the grits in the casserole dish. Top with the bread and the remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar. Bake the casserole until the shrimp is opaque and cooked through and the top is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with the reserved scallions. Serve with extra hot sauce on the side. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 spring onions 
 3 ounces Spanish onion 
 5 ounces cherry tomatoes 
 1/2 cup sherry vinegar, plus 1/2 cup 
 1 1/2 ounces shallots, finely chopped 
 6 sprigs tarragon 
 4 ounces butter, diced 
 8 (3-ounce) sea bass fillets 
 4 large scallops 
 Salt and pepper 
 40 baby asparagus 
 4 whole chives 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the onions and cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Mix together in a bowl, then add 1/2 cup sherry vinegar and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. Place the shallots into a small saucepan and add the remaining 1/2 cup sherry vinegar. Pick off the tarragon leaves, set aside, and add the stalks to the pan. Bring the vinegar mixture to a boil and allow to reduce by 2/3. Remove pan from heat and start to whisk in the diced butter. Keep the pan warm but do not allow it to get hot as this will cause the butter to separate and will split the sauce. When all the butter has been whisked in, pass the sauce through a sieve into a clean pan and keep warm. Remove the onion and cherry tomatoes from the marinade and place in a saucepan. Sweat the mixture over the medium heat until the tomatoes start to break down. Add approximately 1/2 of the remaining marinade and cook slowly over moderate heat for 30 minutes. While the tomatoes and onions are cooking, take the sea bass fillets and the scallops and season them with salt and pepper. Sear the sea bass fillets in a very hot non-stick frying pan, skin-side down first. When golden brown, remove from the frying pan, place onto a baking tray and cook in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes. Do exactly the same with the scallops. Blanch the baby asparagus and chives separately, in boiling, salted water. Remove from the water and tie the asparagus into bundles of 10 using a blanched chive. To assemble, put 1 piece of sea bass on each plate and top with the confit of tomatoes. Place the second piece of sea bass on top and lean the asparagus bundle against the sea bass. Take the tarragon leaves that were set aside and roughly chop them. Add the tarragon to the warm sauce and spoon sauce around plate. Add a scallop to the side of each plate and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 8 cups dashi 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 3 tablespoons each: dark soy sauce and light soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 2 tablespoons mirin 
 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces 
 6 green onions, cut into 2-inch lengths and halved lengthwise 
 6 to 8 fresh shiitake mushroom caps, crisscrossed on top with knife 
 1/4 head Napa cabbage cut into 1-inch squares 
 1 pound fresh, refrigerated or frozen udon noodles 
 Instructions: 
 In a large pot, bring dashi just to a boil, then add the salt, soy sauces, sugar and mirin. Stir to dissolve, then bring the broth back to a gentle boil, and add the chicken pieces. Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 10 minutes, skimming any foam. Add the onions, mushrooms, and cabbage and simmer another 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of unsalted water to a rapid boil. Add the noodles, bring back to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they just begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander and rinse under cold running water while rubbing noodles to remove surface starch. Serve immediately, placing noodles in individual warm, deep bowls. Ladle hot broth over the noodles, and arrange pieces of chicken, onions, and mushrooms on the noodles. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 medium red onion, very thinly sliced 
 1 pound celery (about half a bunch), with leaves 
 3 ounces soppressata salami, in a chunk or sliced (see ShopSmart, below) 
 6 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces 
 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 to 2-ounce wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 
 Instructions: 
 To mellow the raw bite of the onion, soak the slices in cold water for 10 minutes, then drain, pat dry, and put them in a serving bowl. Peel the tough, stringy fibers from the celery ribs. Slice the celery and some of the inner leaves very thinly on an angle. If you have a chunk of soppressata, dice it; if slices, cut them into thin strips. Toss the celery, soppressata, basil, lemon zest, and lemon juice with the onion. Season with salt and a generous grinding of pepper. Toss the salad with the olive oil. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates. Use a vegetable peeler to shave large, thin pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano over each serving and serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups sugar 
 1 3/4 cups 
 3/4 cup cocoa powder 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 2 eggs 
 1 cup milk 
 1/2 cup vegetable oil 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 1 cup boiling water 
 Lemon juice, for wiping out bowl 
 10 large egg whites 
 2 1/2 cups sugar 
 3 cups (6 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus for greasing cake pans 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon 
 Pinch salt 
 3 tablespoons hazelnut spread 
 1/2 cup chopped toffee crunch bar 
 Instructions: 
 For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a stand mixer bowl. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the boiling water; the batter will be thin. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes, and then unmold the cakes onto wire racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: Wipe out the mixer bowl with paper towels and lemon juice to remove any trace of grease. Add the egg whites and sugar, and heat over a pot of simmering water, whisking constantly but gently, until the mixture reaches 140 degrees F on a candy thermometer. (If you don't have a candy thermometer, the sugar should be completely dissolved and the egg whites hot.) Transfer the mixer bowl to the stand mixer and whip on high speed, using the whisk attachment, until the meringue is white, thick and glossy, and holds stiff peaks, 8 to 10 minutes. Switch over to the paddle attachment and, with the mixer on low speed, add the butter cubes, one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated and smooth. Add the vanilla, salt and hazelnut spread. (Makes 10 cups.) To assemble: Level and tort both cakes--you will now have 4 layers. Place one cake layer on a cake board, spread with a generous layer (about 1/2 inch) of the hazelnut buttercream, and sprinkle the toffee crunch on top. Repeat until you have stacked all 4 cake layers. Frost the cake with the remaining buttercream. Slice and enjoy. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup milk 
 1/2 stick unsalted butter 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 1 cup flour 
 4 eggs 
 3 cups peanut or veggie oil, for frying 
 9 ounces Mexican chocolate 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
 Pinch salt 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the dough: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, butter and salt and bring to a medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and whisk to combine. Switch over to a wooden spoon and cook the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and it has a slightly sweaty sheen on it, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Using an electric mixer beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Do not add the next egg until the last one is completely combined. Place the batter in a pastry bag outfitted with a large star tip. Reserve. To make the chocolate sauce: Place 1-inch of water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. In a heatproof mixing bowl, combine the chocolate, heavy cream, butter and corn syrup. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and all the ingredients are well combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and remove the saucepan from the heat. Reserve. For the cinnamon sugar: In a bag or large mixing bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon In a large saucepan heat the oil to 325 degrees F. Pipe the dough into the hot oil in sticks or desired shapes (I kinda like to make mine a little curly). This might be a little tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of it. Fry the dough until it is brown and crispy on all sides, 60 to 90 seconds total, turning frequently. Fry in batches. Remove the churros from the oil, blot on paper towels for a second and then toss in the cinnamon sugar. Be sure to do this while the churros are still hot. Serve immediately, while churros and melted chocolate are warm. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups blanched slivered almonds 
 Kosher salt 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 4 eggs 
 1 cup milk 
 4 cleaned sole fillets (6 ounces each) 
 1 large or 3 small shallots, finely chopped 
 1 cup white wine 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 1/4 chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Set a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the almonds and toast until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and set aside. Return the pan to medium heat (if you have 2 pans you can work simultaneously at this point, i.e. 2 fillets per pan) and add a 2-count of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter to each pan. Put the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In another shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge the fillets in the seasoned flour, then dip them into the egg mixture. Allow some of the excess egg to drain off, then add them to the hot pan. Cook 2 pieces at a time. Fry for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then carefully turn the fish over to cook the other side. With a spoon, baste the fillets with the butter sauce. Repeat basting to ensure the fish remains moist. Once the other side is cooked (about 30 seconds) carefully remove the fillets from the pan to a serving platter. Repeat with remaining 2 fillets and a 2-count of oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Once the fillets have been removed the pan, add the chopped shallots and gently saute over low heat until translucent, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and finish with the lemon juice. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To serve, spoon the sauce over the top of the fillets and sprinkle generously with the toasted almonds. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 20 bananas, ripe but still firm 
 2 cups creme fraiche 
 2 cups diced strawberries 
 1 cup honey, for drizzling 
 Ground cinnamon

 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cups warm water 
 1 packet active dry yeast 
 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus a pinch 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 1 large egg 
 1/2 cup evaporated milk 
 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 
 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 
 Butter 
 Vegetable oil, for deep frying 
 1 cup powdered sugar for dusting 
 Instructions: 
 Begin by activating the yeast. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook (or large mixing bowl) attachment add the warm water, yeast and pinch of sugar. Stir and set aside until the yeast has dissolved, about 10 minutes. To the bowl add the 1/4 cup of sugar, salt, egg, and the evaporated milk. With the mixer on low, add half the flour and mix until just combined. Add the shortening, and then gradually add the remaining flour until the dough forms into a mass. Turn off the mixer and transfer to floured surface. Add more flour, if needed, until you have an even, medium-textured (it should be pretty firm) dough. Add the dough to a large buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for at least 3 to 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator. Once rested, gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle a little more flour on top so you can work with the dough. Gently shape the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle so it can be cut into squares. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter cut into squares, (you should yield 12 large squares, depending on how thick you rolled the dough). Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Heat about 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-based pot over medium heat, (you want to make sure there is plenty of room as the beignets will puff up when cooked) to 350 degrees F. Fry the beignets in batches, about 3 minutes per batch. Turn them in the oil while they fry to brown evenly on both sides. Remove from the oil a paper towel lined sheet pan and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining dough. To serve, transfer beignets to a serving platter and dust generously with powdered sugar. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying 
 2 green plantains, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 
 Flaked sea salt 
 Instructions: 
 In a heavy pot, add enough oil to fill halfway. Heat until a deep-frying thermometer reads 350 degrees F or the handle of a wooden spoon begins to sizzle immediately when dipped in the oil. Add the plantains and fry until bright yellow and slightly golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon to a sheet of parchment paper. Make sure all pieces are standing tall on the cut side, then place another sheet over the top. Using a small plate, glass or other flat item smash each piece into a 1/4-inch jagged circle. Place the plantain discs back in the oil and fry for 4 to 6 more minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Remove to a wire rack and sprinkle with salt. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup red wine 
 2 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable broth 
 1 bay leaf 
 5 to 6 black peppercorns 
 Instructions: 
 Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat. Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3. At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one. Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it's a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 packed cup brown sugar 
 1/2 cup half-and-half 
 4 tablespoons butter

 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
 3 tablespoons sugar 
 1 large egg yolk 
 1 cup all-purpose flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off) 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
 1 pound cream cheese 
 1 cup sugar 
 One 16-ounce container sour cream 
 3 large eggs 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: One 3-inch deep 9-inch springform pan; a 10 by 15-inch jellyroll pan Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom of the springform pan and line with parchment or waxed paper. Set aside. To make the base: Beat together the butter and sugar by hand until light and fluffy. Beat in the yolk until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. With a rubber spatula, gently fold into the butter mixture. The mixture will be crumbly. Place the dough in the pan and use your hands to pat it down evenly and firmly over the bottom. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and baked through. Transfer to a rack and reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. To make the batter: In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on the lowest speed just until smooth, no more than 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl and beater. Add the sugar in a stream, mixing for no more than 30 seconds. Stop and scrape again. Add 1 cup of sour cream and mix only until it is absorbed, no more than 30 seconds. Repeat with the remaining sour cream. Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing only until each is absorbed; stop and scrape after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract. Wrap heavy-duty aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan so it comes at least 1 inch up the sides. Pour the batter into the pan. Place the pan in a jellyroll pan or roasting pan and pour warm water into the pan to a depth of 1/2-inch. Bake the cheesecake for about 55 minutes, or until it is lightly colored and firm except for the very center. Remove from the oven and lift the cheesecake out of the hot water. Remove the foil and let cool completely on a rack. Wrap the cheesecake and chill overnight. To unmold the cheesecake, run a knife or thin spatula around the inside of the pan pressing the knife against the pan, not the cake. Unbuckle the pan side and lift off. Leave the cake on the base, or run a spatula under the cake base and slide the cake onto a platter. <|endoftext|>

Add the meat mixture and breadcrumbs to the bowl of a small stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until well combined. Add the Parmesan, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper and mix on medium speed for 3 minutes (do not over mix). Scoop out 18 meatballs using an ice-cream scoop (or form the meatballs to ice-cream-scoop size). Mix the mozzarella, capicola, provolone, ham and salami in a mixing bowl. Stuff each meatball by making a hole in the middle and placing 1 tablespoon of the meat-and-cheese mixture in the center. Seal the meatballs well by pinching them back together. Bake, covered with foil, 45 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 cups half-and-half 
 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 
 3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger 
 2 large eggs 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 Instructions: 
 In a small heavy saucepan bring half-and-half just to a boil with vanilla bean and ginger and remove pan from heat. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean with a knife into pan, reserving pod for another use. While half-and-half mixture is heating, in a bowl with an electric mixer whisk together eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add hot half-and-half mixture in a stream, beating, and transfer to a saucepan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thickened (170 degrees F on a candy thermometer), but do not let it boil, and strain through a fine sieve into metal bowl. Set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool sauce, stirring occasionally. Chill sauce, covered, at least 2 hours, or until very cold. Creme anglaise may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 5 small carrots (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
 3 large beets (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
 1 medium head bok choy, cut in half lengthwise 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
 1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar 
 1 cup cooked quinoa 
 1/4 cup dried cranberries 
 1/4 cup pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) 
 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 
 1 blood orange, peel and white pith removed, cut into chunks or segmented 
 1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a baking dish or sheet pan, toss the carrots, beets and bok choy in 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until the vegetables have caramelized and turned golden in color, about 20 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar and raspberry vinegar in a small mixing bowl. Season the dressing with salt and pepper and reserve for later use. Chop the bok choy into 1-inch pieces and toss into a large mixing bowl; the leaves will fall apart, but crumble them into the mixing bowl too. Add the carrots, beets, quinoa, cranberries, pepitas, parsley and orange segments to the mixing bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss to evenly incorporate. Season with salt and pepper. Top with the crumbled goat cheese and serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Four 1-inch-thick bone-in pork chops (8 to 10 ounces each) 
 Base Brine, recipe follows 
 2/3 cup small-diced pineapple 
 2/3 cup small-diced zucchini 
 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, torn 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 tablespoon chardonnay or white wine vinegar 
 1 teaspoon finely chopped shallots 
 1 teaspoon finely minced jalapenos 
 1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 1/2 cup brown sugar 
 1/3 cup kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 
 3 cloves garlic, smashed 
 1 sprig fresh thyme 
 1 sprig fresh rosemary 
 1 bay leaf 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Place the pork chops into a glass baking dish or bowl and pour the chilled Base Brine over top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. About an hour before serving, make the salsa. Combine the pineapple, zucchini, mint, olive oil, chardonnay, shallots, jalapenos, ginger and some salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Let marinate 1 hour. (This is best if allowed to marinate for 1 hour, but you can also serve it straight away if necessary.) When ready to cook the pork, prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Remove the pork chops from the brine, pat dry and allow to sit out while the grill is preheating. Season the pork chops on all sides with salt and pepper. Place onto the hot grill and cook until the internal temperature registers 145 degrees F on a meat thermometer, 7 to 8 minutes per side for medium. Allow the pork chops to rest for 5 minutes before serving topped with the salsa. Combine the brown sugar, salt, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf and 8 cups (2 quarts) water in a large stockpot and heat just to dissolve the salt and sugar. Chill thoroughly before using. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 3/4 pints (28 ounces) whole milk yogurt or 1 pint (17 1/2 ounces) Greek-style yogurt* (See Cook's Note) 
 Milk, for infusing 
 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 
 6 to 8 tablespoons icing sugar (confectioners') 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground green cardamom seeds 
 2 tablespoon chopped unsalted pistachios 
 2 tablespoon flaked or sliced almonds 
 Edible silver leaf* 
 Pomegranate seeds 
 Instructions: 
 Line a large sieve with a double layer of paper towels. Place a bowl under the sieve and pour the yogurt into the sieve. Refrigerate for as long as possible to allow the liquid to drain off the yogurt. This will take a minimum of 5 to 6 hours. Heat a little milk in a small pan. Place two teaspoons of the milk into a small bowl and crumble the saffron strands into it (the rest of the milk can be used in another dish). Allow the saffron to infuse the milk for about 10 minutes using the back of a spoon to crush the saffron further into the milk. Remove the yogurt from the refrigerator (the liquid in the bowl below can be discarded). Transfer the yogurt to a medium mixing bowl. Sift the sugar into the thickened yogurt, then add the saffron milk and ground cardamom. Cover the bowl, and chill in the refrigerator. To serve, divide the yogurt among 4 bowls and garnish with the nuts, silver leaf, if using, and pomegranate seeds. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Cooking spray 
 2 cups cinnamon-sugar pita chips, lightly crushed 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 1 17-ounce container plain 2-percent Greek yogurt 
 8 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, at room temperature 
 3 large eggs 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 
 Kosher salt 
 2 cups frozen wild blueberries 
 3/4 cup unsweetened pineapple juice 
 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin 
 Instructions: 
 Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with a large piece of foil and place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Put the pita chips into a food processor and pulse until fine. Add the butter and process until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake until the crust is slightly dry in appearance and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Cool completely. Meanwhile, combine the yogurt, cream cheese, eggs, sugar, flour, vanilla, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor and process until well blended and smooth. Pour over the prepared crust and bake until the center is just set, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack, then cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, put the blueberries and pineapple juice in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Stir the dissolved gelatin into the hot blueberry mixture until combined. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, cover and chill until thickened, about 3 hours. After chilling the cheesecake, remove the springform ring. Slice and serve, topped with the blueberry sauce. If the sauce is too thick, rewarm it in the microwave for 20 seconds at a time before spooning over the cheesecake. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 (7-ounce) containers Greek yogurt, such as Fage Total 
 1 hothouse cucumber, unpeeled 
 1/4 cup sour cream 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 
 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 
 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 pound feta, sliced 
 Good olive oil 
 Fresh thyme leaves 
 1/2 pound large kalamata olives with pits 
 Toasted Pita Triangles, recipe follows 
 1 loaf pita bread 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Place the yogurt in a medium bowl. Grate the cucumber on a box grater on the largest grating side and squeeze it with your hands to remove most (but not all) of the liquid. Add the grated cucumber to the yogurt. Add the sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar, dill, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and combine. Taste for seasonings. To serve, artfully arrange salad plates with slices of feta, drizzle them with olive oil, and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Add the olives, pita triangles, and the tzatziki and serve cold or at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice the pita bread into 8 triangles and place them on a sheet pan. Place the sheet pan in the oven and toast the bread for 10 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more if needed 
 1 cup cake flour 
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk 
 2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt 
 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, thawed and juice reserved 
 1 1/2 liters canola oil 
 2 cups confectioners' sugar 
 1/4 cup whole milk 
 Pinch salt 
 Lemon juice 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a doughnut cutter For the doughnuts: Mix the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and salt with a whisk until homogenous. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the sugar and butter until smooth, then add the eggs. Add the yogurt and mix until smooth. Slowly add the dry ingredients, then add the blueberries and juice. Do not over-mix! If the mix is too wet, add a bit of flour. Cover and let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge. Heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 350 degrees F (less and you will get greasy doughnuts, more you will get burnt doughnuts). Roll out the dough on a floured surface, roughly 3/4-inch thick, then cut out the doughnuts into any shape you want. Drop the doughnuts into the hot oil a few at a time. Pay attention, this next bit is important; cook them just until they float, about 20 seconds. As soon as they float, flip them over. Once you flip them, do not mess with them!!! Just let them cook. When they are completely done on one side, flip them and cook on the other side. Again, do not mess with the doughnuts! Let them cook until done! Pull the doughnuts out and let them cool on a wire rack. For the glaze: Mix up the confectioners' sugar, milk, salt and lemon juice to taste. When the doughnuts are cool to the touch, glaze them. Then eat and enjoy. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 ounces finely grated fresh ginger 
 6 ounces sugar 
 7 1/2 cups filtered water 
 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 Instructions: 
 Place the ginger, sugar, and 1/2 cup of the water into a 2-quart saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, cover and allow to steep for 1 hour. Pour the syrup through a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing down to get all of the juice out of the mixture. Chill quickly by placing over and ice bath and stirring or set in the refrigerator, uncovered, until at least room temperature, 68 to 72 degrees F. Using a funnel, pour the syrup into a clean 2-liter plastic bottle and add the yeast, lemon juice and remaining 7 cups of water. Place the cap on the bottle, gently shake to combine and leave the bottle at room temperature for 48 hours. Open and check for desired amount of carbonation. It is important that once you achieve your desired amount of carbonation that you refrigerate the ginger ale. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, opening the bottle at least once a day to let out excess carbonation. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 5 large egg yolks 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 2 1/4 cups (18 ounces) whole milk 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 vanilla bean 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar until pale yellow and thickens up. Combine the whole milk, heavy cream and 1 vanilla bean, sliced in half lengthwise in a saucepan. Heat the mixture just until it starts to bubble along the edges. Do not allow the mixture to boil. Remove from the heat. Remove the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds with the tip if a small knife and add the seeds back into the milk mixture. Discard the vanilla bean shell. While whisking the egg mixture add in about a cup of the warm milk mixture and combine together. Then add in the rest of the egg mixture to the milk. Heat the mixture slowly to 175 to 180 degrees F. The custard should be thickened and coat the back of a wooden spoon. Do not allow the custard to simmer. Strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve, cover and refrigerate until well chilled. You can transfer this custard into the ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions. This will make vanilla gelato, or you can make the following variations. Espresso: add 1/2 cup of chilled espresso coffee into the custard. Chocolate: add 3 ounces melted bittersweet chocolate into the warm custard before chilling. Pistachio or hazelnuts: In a blender add 6 ounces shelled pistachios with the heavy cream and puree before adding into the saucepan. Amaretto: Stir in 1/2 cup of crushed amaretto cookies into the milk before heating and add 1-ounce amaretto liqueur into the finished chilled custard before freezing. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 12 whole radicchio leaves 
 10 cups ice water 
 Caponata: 
 About 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
 1 1/2 cups diced onion (1/4-inch dice) 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 anchovy fillets, chopped 
 2 teaspoons chili flakes 
 2 tablespoons caper juice 
 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 
 1 eggplant (about 1 pound) peeled and diced into small pieces (see Chef's Note) 
 1 tablespoon roughly chopped capers 
 1/2 cup peeled, seeded, and 1/4-inch diced roasted red bell peppers, recipe follows 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 4 whole red peppers 
 1/2 cup olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Soak lettuce leaves for about 10 minutes in ice water to reduce bitterness. Wrap in damp paper towel to keep moist until ready to serve. In large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and saute briefly until brown. Add the onion and brown lightly, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add a pinch each of salt and pepper (go easy on the salt because the anchovies will add that extra bit of saltiness). Continue to cook until the onion is well browned, about 5 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook and stir until they melt into the onion. Add the chili flakes, then the caper juice and stand back to avoid getting splattered. Stir and scrape all around the pan. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar, return the heat to high, and boil until reduced and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the eggplant and saute until browned and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Saute only a small bunch at a time, to avoid letting the eggplant boil in its own juices. If the pan gets too dry, add more olive oil as the cooking progresses - if you add too much olive oil early in the process, the eggplant will absorb all of it and still need more. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan well so nothing burns. Season with salt and pepper. Scrape into a bowl. Add the garlic-anchovy mixture to the eggplant with the capers and remaining vinegar. Stir well, then scrape into a bowl. Stir in the roasted peppers and parsley and taste again for seasoning. Let cool to room temperature before serving. When ready to assemble, place 1 to 2 tablespoons of caponata in chilled lettuce cups. Wrap into ball and enjoy. Brush peppers with olive oil (this carries the heat into crevices, helping the skin to blister more evenly). Roast the peppers whole under a broiler or on the stovetop, or grill, turning occasionally until the skins blister and char all over. Place in paper bag, and let steam to loosen the skins, for about 15 minutes. Working over the bowl to catch any juices, peel off the skins. Seed the peppers, then slice into long strips and place in a clean bowl. Pour the juices left in the steaming bowl over the peppers and refrigerate for up to several days. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups whole wheat flour 
 3/4 to 1 cup water 
 1 cup mashed potatoes 
 2 tablespoons minced red onion 
 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves 
 1 tablespoon garam masala 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves 
 Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the flour and water in a bowl and knead until it forms a smooth round ball similar to a stiff pizza dough. Cover the dough and set aside. Put the mashed potatoes, red onion, fenugreek leaves, garam masala, and cilantro into a bowl and mix well. Taste for seasoning and add salt, and pepper, to taste. Take a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball and roll it into a disc with your fingers. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and using a lightly-floured rolling pin, roll out the disc into a thin patty (like a tortilla). Place 1/4 cup of the filling into the middle of the patty and then fold the edge of the dough over the mixture and form into a ball, with the filling in the center. Roll out the paratha gently, being careful not to squeeze the filling out. Put a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and place a paratha into it. Cook until brown bubbly spots appear and then flip the paratha and cook the second side until it is done, about 3 minutes per side. Continue until all the parathas are done. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 Ingredients: 
 1 small watermelon, rind washed well 
 Lemonade, as needed 
 2 ounces vodka or white rum, or as needed, optional 
 Lemon slices, for garnish 
 Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: an immersion blender and a cocktail umbrella (or whatever fun garnish you'd like) Cut off a small piece of the bottom of the watermelon so that it can sit without rolling. Set the watermelon in a bowl to stabilize it and catch any drips/overflow. Using an immersion blender (but not turning it on yet), press it gently into the top of the watermelon and twist to score the rind. Then twist and push harder, working in a circle to pop out the top "plug" of rind. If your immersion blender head is not sharp, you may have to use a knife to help get the "plug" out. Now for the fun part: Press the immersion blender into the flesh and pulse to start liquefying it. Make sure to scrape down the sides and be careful not to go through the bottom. The process can be a little messy, so wear an apron. Once the flesh is mostly liquid, top it off with lemonade and a shot of vodka or rum if desired. Garnish with lemon slices, mint sprigs and a cocktail umbrella or other fun garnish. <|endoftext|>

 Instructions: 
 Make the seasoning: Whisk the seasoning salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne, poultry seasoning, lemon pepper and 2 teaspoons black pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons seasoning in a separate bowl. Rinse the wings under cold water and place in a shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with the seasoning, then refrigerate, covered, 1 hour. Make the batter: Whisk the eggs, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, cayenne and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a medium bowl. Put the flour in a shallow dish or pie plate. In a large deep fryer or Dutch oven, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Dip the wings in the eggs, then in the flour. Place the wings, three at a time, in the hot oil and fry until golden, 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Make sure the oil returns to 350 degrees F before adding the next batch. Sprinkle the wings with the reserved seasoning to make them extra hot. Make the sauce: Mix the sour cream, horseradish, chili sauce, cayenne, and salt and black pepper to taste. Serve with the wings. Photograph by Con Poulos <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons good olive oil 
 2 cups chopped Spanish onion (1 large) 
 1 1/2 cups small-diced celery (2 stalks) 
 1 pound ground beef 
 1 pound ground veal 
 1 pound ground pork 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 
 3 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 
 2/3 cup whole milk 
 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 
 2 1/2 cups panko (Japanese bread flakes) 
 Garlic Sauce, recipe follows 
 3/4 cup good olive oil 
 10 garlic cloves, peeled 
 2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent but not browned. Set aside to cool slightly. Place the beef, veal, pork, parsley, thyme, chives, eggs, milk, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Put the panko in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until the panko is finely ground. Add the onion mixture and the panko to the meat mixture. With clean hands, gently toss the mixture together, making sure it's combined but not compacted. Place a piece of parchment paper on a sheet pan. Pat the meat into a flat rectangle and then press the sides in until it forms a cylinder down the middle of the pan (this will ensure no air pockets). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until a thermometer inserted in the middle reads 155 degrees F to 160 degrees F. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve hot with the Garlic Sauce. Combine the oil and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Be careful not to burn the garlic or it will be bitter. Remove the garlic from the oil and set aside. (I save the oil for vinaigrettes.) Combine the chicken stock, butter and cooked garlic in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook at a full boil for 35 to 40 minutes, until slightly thickened. Mash the garlic with a fork, whisk in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and taste for seasonings. Spoon the warm sauce over the meatloaf. Photographs by Steve Giralt <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 pounds medium red bliss or other waxy-style potatoes, skin-on and scrubbed 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more 
 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Half the potatoes lengthwise and cut them into 1-inch-wide wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the potatoes with the butter and 1 teaspoon of salt. Spread the potatoes out on a roasting pan large enough to hold them in a single layer. (Arrange the potatoes cut-side down, to ensure crisply browned edges.) Roast the potatoes until golden brown, about 45 minute. Add the garlic and stir to coat the potatoes evenly. Continue to roast until the potatoes and garlic are evenly browned, about 15 minutes more. (Take care that the garlic doesn't burn.) Remove from the oven and mix with the parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 striped bass, 5 to 6 pounds, gills removed, fins trimmed 
 4 egg whites 
 1/2 cup water 
 2 (3 pound) boxes of kosher salt 
 1 handful parsley 
 1 fennel bulb, (with stem) quartered 
 Several sprigs thyme 
 1 lemon, sliced thin 
 1/2 orange, sliced thin 
 Olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 Heat oven to 450 degrees. Cover the bottom of a baking sheet large enough to hold the fish with parchment paper. Rinse fish inside and out with cold water and drain. Dry with paper towels. Stuff body cavity with herbs and citrus, saving a few lemon slices for garnish. Set aside. Pour 1 box of salt into a large bowl, add egg whites and water, then the second box of salt. Use your hands to work mixture to a mortar-like consistency. Lay down a 1/2-inch thick bed for the fish to lay on with a 1-inch clearance on all sides. Lay the fish on this bed and pile the remainder of the salt mortar on top. Work into a smooth dome completely encasing the fish. (Don't worry if the head or tail poke out a little.) Cook approximately 35 minutes. Check for doneness by pushing the probe of an instant read thermometer through the salt into the fish. When temperature reaches 130 degrees, remove from oven, and rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Open the fish at the table by hitting the dome several times with a small hammer and lifting off the slabs of salt. Brush away any stray salt. Gently pull out dorsal (back) fin. Using a fish knife or serrated pie server, make a single incision all the way down the back of the fish and around the gill plate. Then lift the skin off working from the head to the tail. Remove meat from top side of fish, going down one side of the spine then the other. Grasp the tail and remove the skeleton, (it should come up intact). The meat revealed below will slide right off the skin. Sprinkle meat with a little virgin oil and lemon juice. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds potatoes (about 4 large potatoes), peeled and cut into chunks, boiled and cooled to room temperature 
 1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 egg, beaten 
 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan 
 1/2 cup steamed spinach, cooled, and chopped fine in a food processor 
 1/4 cup milk (approximately), if needed to moisten dough 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 
 1 medium onion, minced 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 cup hot milk 
 1 (8-ounce) can chunky tomato sauce 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 8 ounces soft cream cheese 
 1/4 cup fresh chives, chopped 
 Instructions: 
 Mash potatoes in a bowl and 1 cup of the flour, reserving the rest to use if the gnocchi is not light and fluffy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add beaten egg and cheese and mix everything well. Remove half the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the chopped spinach. Knead the ingredients in each bowl lightly and on a floured board form into long cylinders. The gnocchi should have a light texture which is cohesive enough to remain whole while it is being boiled. If the mixture in either bowl is too wet, add the additional flour until the proper consistency is achieved. Conversely add milk if the dough is too dry, using only enough as needed to bring the dough together. Cut the long cylinders into pieces about 1-inch long and crimp with your fingertips into gnocchi dumplings which are roughly marquise-shaped. Bring a pot of water to boil for the gnocchi. Melt butter in a saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked gnocchi, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add milk and allow to thicken. Stir in tomato sauce and heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add cream cheese. Blend with an immersion blender. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly. Boil the gnocchi until al dente, drain, transfer to a serving dish, and spoon sauce over. Sprinkle with chives. <|endoftext|>

When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. Adjust the consistency with additional chicken stock if necessary. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 5 to 6 cups diced peeled butternut squash (about 1 large or 2 small) 
 1/2 cup ground amaretti cookies 
 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs 
 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese 
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
 2 to 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2 large eggs 
 3 large egg yolks 
 Semolina for sprinkling 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
 Grated Parmesan cheese for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the butternut squash. Cook until the squash is just starting to caramelize and is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the water to cover and cook until the squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Transfer the squash to a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the amaretti, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper and blend until smooth. Flour a large cutting board or work surface. Place 2 cups of the flour and the salt on the board and make a wide well in it. Place the eggs and egg yolks in the well. With a fork, follow the perimeter of the well, bringing in small amounts of flour and continuing all the way around, until gradually most of the four is absorbed. If necessary, add up to 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Put the dough through a pasta machine, folding into halves each time and reinserting 15 to 20 times, to knead it. Continue until the pasta is paper-thin. Lay out the sheets of dough and cut them into 4-inch squares; you should have about 40 to 42 squares. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling on one corner of each square. Fold over the filled portion, press down around the filling, and place on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper and sprinkled with semolina. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until it begins to foam and brown, about 4 minutes. Add the sage, salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of water, salted if desired, to a boil over high heat. Add the tortelli and cook until they are tender, about 3 minutes.

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 pound whole shelled hazelnuts 
 1 cup cake flour, plus more for dusting 
 1/2 pound unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into chunks 
 1 cup sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
 1 teaspoon lemon zest 
 1 egg 
 1 1/2 cups raspberry jam 
 Powdered sugar, for decorating 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Position the rack in the middle of the oven. Spread hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Turn oven off since you will not need it on again for at least 45 minutes. Empty nuts onto a folded towel, enclosing them between the folds, and rub them to remove their skins. Transfer the nuts to a strainer and carefully discard the skins. Allow nuts to cool to room temperature. Put the hazelnuts in a food processor fitted with the stainless-steel blade and pulse a few times. Add cake flour and process until the nuts are finely ground. Set aside. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and lemon zest on medium speed until light and creamy. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Over medium speed, add the egg and continue mixing for 1 more minute. Reduce the speed to low, add the hazelnut-flour mixture, and continue mixing until well blended into a smooth dough. Divide the dough into 2 portions, with 1 portion about 8 ounces or 1/3 of the dough. Transfer to a medium pastry bag fitted with a number 1 plain tip and set aside. With the remaining 2/3 of the dough (about 20 ounces), form into a 1-inch flat disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. With a marking pen, trace a 16 by 13-inch rectangle shape on parchment paper. Place paper, marked side down, onto a baking sheet. With the reserved dough in the pastry bag, pipe straight parallel lines, about 1-inch apart, inside the marked rectangle. Then pipe a second set of parallel lines at a 45 degree angle to the first set of lines to make a trellis shape. Refrigerate until needed (dough should be well chilled before using). With more cake flour, lightly dust a pastry board or work surface with flour. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to a rectangular shape, about 15 by 12 inches by 1/4-inch thick. Transfer dough to a parchment lined baking sheet and trim any excess dough to make an even rectangle. Bake for 20 minutes, or until dough starts to color. Remove baking sheet from the oven and transfer to a rack. Leave oven on. Allow dough to cool for at least 10 minutes. Spread raspberry jam over the entire surface of the cooled dough. Carefully place the refrigerated trellis-shaped dough over the jam. Return to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until crust is golden in color. Allow to cool completely before cutting. Trim edges and then cut into 3 by 1-inch bars. Lightly dust bars with powdered sugar. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 (5 to 6) pound roasting chicken 
 4 cloves garlic, crushed 
 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped 
 3 bay leaves 
 1 tablespoon each of dried thyme, rosemary and sage 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 
 Several sprigs fresh thyme, rosemary and sage 
 1 cup chicken broth 
 Butcher's twine 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and place a heavy roasting pan to preheat in the oven. Season the inside of the chicken cavity with salt and pepper. Put the crushed garlic, chopped onion and dry herbs inside the cavity of the chicken. Using the twine, tie the legs closed. Use the olive oil to rub the entire outside of the chicken with an even coat of oil. Pick the herb from the stem and coarsely chop them before sprinkling the herb liberally and evenly on the chicken. Place the chicken into the preheated roasting pan and roast at 425 degrees for the first 45 minutes of roasting. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for an additional 1 hour. Remove from the oven and pierce the thigh: if the juices run clear when pierced allow to rest on a platter for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. If the juices are still pink return to the oven for more roasting time. While the chicken is resting, place the roasting pan on top of the stove, remove any chicken fat with a spoon, and, over medium heat, deglaze the pan drippings with the chicken broth. Use a spoon to scrape up all the crusty bits (that's where the most concentrated flavor is) and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and strain the liquid into a gravy boat to pass at the table. <|endoftext|>

Remove from the heat and set a food mill fitted with the smallest die, on top of the pot. Add 1 cup of potatoes at a time to the mill. Once all of the potatoes have passed through the mill, stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds parsnips, peeled and chopped 
 8 cups (2 quarts) milk 
 1 tablespoon honey 
 Kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 6 large Roma tomatoes 
 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 Kosher salt 
 30 asparagus spears 
 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 
 2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 
 Six 8-ounce teres major steaks (also called shoulder tender or petit filet) 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 cups Demi-Glace, recipe follows 
 1/4 cup grapeseed oil 
 8 pounds veal bones (joints preferred) 
 24 cups (6 quarts) ice water 
 8 ounces onions, roughly chopped 
 4 ounces carrots, peeled and roughly chopped 
 4 ounces celery, roughly chopped 
 6 ounces tomato paste 
 5 sprigs fresh thyme 
 1 bay leaf 
 8 cups (2 quarts) red wine 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 For the parsnip puree: In a small pot, combine the parsnips and milk and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the parsnips until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the parsnips, saving the milk. Put the parsnips in a food processor with the honey and puree. Add some milk to adjust the consistency (you'll need 1 to 2 cups of the liquid). Season with salt and pepper. For the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the ends off of each tomato and then cut each tomato into 3 slices. In a bowl, toss the tomato slices with the oil, salt and pepper. Arrange the tomato slices on a baking sheet and roast until tender and the edges are brown, 10 to 15 minutes. For the asparagus: Add 1 gallon of water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to a large pot and bring to a rolling boil. Set up an ice bath for shocking the asparagus after blanching. Blanch the Asparagus in batches in the boiling water for 45 seconds to a minute, and then transfer to the ice bath. Dry off the asparagus with a towel and set aside. For the steak: Heat a skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Depending on the size of the skillet (and how many batches you'll cook), add 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons grapeseed oil. Salt and pepper the steaks and sear on each side (the teres major is a triangle shape) for 3 to 4 minutes. Once all of the steaks are cooked, put them all into a pan and add the butter. Allow the steaks to rest for 10 minutes, basting with the butter occasionally. To finish the asparagus, heat a saute pan over high heat, add the grapeseed oil and saute the asparagus for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For plating: Divide the parsnip puree among 6 plates and drag it from one side of the plate to the other. Shingle 3 slices of tomato across the parsnip puree. Slice each steak into 5 slices and shingle over the top of the tomatoes. Pour 2 to 3 ounces of the Demi-Glace over and around each plate. Lean 5 pieces of asparagus up on the side of each steak. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly. Transfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities. While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture. Add the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours. In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. When the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again. <|endoftext|>

Unroll the phyllo pastry dough, cover with plastic wrap and a damp tea or kitchen towel. Peel off one sheet and keep the rest covered so that it doesn't dry out. Lay the pastry sheet flat on a clean surface, and brush with melted butter. Fold in one third of the pastry lengthwise towards the middle. Brush again with the butter and fold in the other side to make a long triple-layered strip. Place one rounded teaspoon of the filling mixture at one end of the strip, leaving a 1-inch border. Take the right corner and fold diagonally to the left, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again along the upper crease of the triangle. Keep folding in this way until you reach the end of the strip. Brush the outer surface with more butter. Place the triangle onto a baking sheet and cover while you make the rest of the samosas. Sprinkle over a few sesame seeds, if using. Bake in the center of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway through the cooking time. To serve, place the samosas onto a large serving plate with a bowlful of chutney. * Can be found in specialty Asian markets. <|endoftext|>

With the motor running, slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of the oil. Process until the harissa is completely pureed and all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Makes about 2 1/2 cups of harissa. Mix 3/4 cup of the harissa with the remaining 1 cup canola oil to make the harissa oil. For the fried olives: Line up three medium bowls. Add the flour to the first, the egg to the second and the panko to the third. Working in small batches, with the help of a slotted spoon, toss a handful of the olives in the flour. Lift, shake off excess flour and quickly dip the olives in the egg mixture. Dredge them in the panko, shake off excess and add the olives to the egg mixture a second time. Dredge once again in the panko, shaking the olives around to coat evenly. Shake off excess and transfer to an airtight container until ready to use. (The olives can be breaded up to a day in advance.) In a deep skillet or medium pot, heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees F. Fry the breaded olives until golden brown, about one minute. Drain on paper towels. Serve the fried olives piping hot with labne drizzled with harissa oil on the side. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 6 tablespoons butter 
 3 medium red onions, thinly sliced 
 3 sprigs fresh marjoram 
 3 sprigs fresh thyme 
 2 bay leaves 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1/2 cup red wine 
 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
 4 cups beef stock 
 Kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil 
 One 32-ounce dry-aged (28 days) bone-in rib-eye, room temperature 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 6 sprigs fresh thyme 
 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled, smashed 
 Pommes Aligot, for serving, optional, recipe follows 
 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled 
 1 cup heavy cream, heated 
 1 cup shredded Gruyere 
 Chives, for garnishing 
 Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 
 Instructions: 
 For the onion confit: Heat a large enameled cast-iron pot over medium heat. Add the butter; when it begins to foam, add the red onions, marjoram, thyme, bay leaves and sugar, and sprinkle liberally with salt. When the onions begin to caramelize, add the red wine and balsamic vinegar and reduce to dry. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add 1 cup of the beef stock; cook until reduced to a glaze. Repeat until all the beef stock has been used. Turn off the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. For the rib-eye: Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat; add the oil. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil is just below smoking, place the steak into the pan. Once a nice sear has developed, flip the steak and add the butter, thyme and garlic. If the garlic or steak begins to burn, reduce the heat. Cook, basting the steak with the bubbling butter, until an internal temperature of 125 degrees F has been reached for medium-rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 7 to 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with the French onion confit. Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with room temperature water and season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until fork tender. Drain the potatoes, saving 1/2 cup of the cooking water for thinning out if needed. Pass the potatoes through a food mill into a large bowl. Add the butter and heavy cream, and fold together with a spatula until combined. Fold in the shredded cheese. If the potatoes get too thick, thin them out with a little of the cooking water. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve garnished with chives and a drizzle of olive oil. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 oranges, preferably seedless 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger 
 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
 2 teaspoons honey 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 2 medium shallots, finely chopped 
 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 avocados 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves, plus whole leaves for garnish 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves, plus whole leaves for garnish 
 4 whole leaves Boston lettuce, washed and dried well 
 4 while leaves red leaf lettuce, washed and dried well 
 Sliced pickled ginger, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Segment and juice 3 of the oranges in the following way: Cut both ends off 1 of the oranges and place it, cut side up, on a cutting board. Using a sharp, flexible knife, cut the skin and white membrane from the orange. Use a sawing motion and cut from top to bottom following the contours of the orange. Free the orange segments by cutting along the seams that separate them from each other. Do this over a bowl to collect any juices. Reserve the segments separately and squeeze what's left of the orange over the bowl to collect the juice. Do the same with the remaining 2 oranges. Strain the juice into a measuring cup: You should have about 3/4 cup; if not, juice the remaining orange and add as much as needed. Combine the ginger, mayonnaise, mustard, and honey with 1/2 cup of the orange juice in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a small bowl, combine half of the chopped shallots with 3 tablespoons of the remaining orange juice. Whisk in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cut the avocados lengthwise up to the large pit in the middle. Gently twist apart the 2 halves and remove the pit. Wedge a teaspoon between the skin and the flesh and remove the flesh in 1 piece. Cut the avocados into 1-inch pieces and put them into the bowl with the honey-and-ginger dressing. Add the remaining shallots, the chopped mint and the chopped cilantro, and mix together lightly so as not to break up the avocado. When ready to serve, set aside 8 orange segments. Toss the rest with the whole lettuce leaves and just enough of the orange-and-olive oil vinaigrette to coat. Divide the lettuce and oranges among 4 plates. Spoon some avocado onto each plate (there will be some dressing left in the bowl). Top with the reserved orange segments and drizzle any remaining honey-and-ginger dressing over the salad. Garnish with whole mint and cilantro leaves, and, if you like, some pickled ginger. <|endoftext|>

Let the turkey rest for 10 minutes before serving with the remaining Cranberry Apple Glaze. Combine the apple cider, cranberries, cranberry juice, maple syrup and apple cider vinegar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then reduce to a simmer until the liquid has been reduced by 2 cups and the cranberries have burst, 18 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and then transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Yield: 1 1/2 cups. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound macaroni elbows or cavatapi corkscrew shaped pasta twists 
 Salt 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, plus some for drizzling 
 3/4 pound chorizo, 1 package, casing removed and diced 
 1 (15-ounce) can diced fire roasted tomatoes, drained 
 1 small onion, finely chopped 
 2 chipotle in adobo and their juices, chopped or 1 tablespoon ground chipotle chili 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 3 cups whole milk 
 1 cup chicken stock 
 3 cups shredded smoked Cheddar 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Place a pot of water on to boil for macaroni. When it boils, salt water and cook pasta until a little under done, just shy of al dente. While pasta cooks, place a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and chorizo. Brown the chorizo then add the canned tomatoes to the pan and heat them through. Remove from heat and reserve. While chorizo begins to cook, heat a medium sauce pot over medium-low heat. Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, then add onions and chipotles and cook 3 to 5 minutes to sweat it out and turn the juices sweet. Raise heat up a bit, add the flour and whisk together until mixture bubbles up. Cook 1 minute more. Whisk in milk and stock and raise heat up a little more to bring the sauce to a quick boil. Once it bubbles, drop heat back to a rolling simmer sauce to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain macaroni or pasta. Add cooked pasta back to the large pot. Add cheese to milk sauce and stir to melt, a minute or so. Stir in chorizo and tomatoes and season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over cooked pasta in large pot and toss to combine. Transfer to a large serving platter, garnish with chives and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup lukewarm water 
 1 package instant dry yeast 
 2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 cup cherry tomatoes 
 2 teaspoons sea salt 
 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves removed 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Measure the water in a measuring cup, stir in the yeast and let develop for 10 minutes. It should look foamy when it's ready. Meanwhile, add the flour and kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Turn on to whisk together and run for a minute or so to create a well. With the mixer running, add the water and yeast in a stream. Turn the mixer up to speed 2 and knead until the dough comes away from the bowl and it looks smooth and feels elastic but still sticky, 5 to 7 minutes. Flour your hands and knead the dough for a minute on the counter. Grease a large glass bowl with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the dough, flip on both sides and cover with a clean tea towel. Place the dough in a warm spot to rise until it is double in size, about 1 hour. Spread a half sheet tray with the remaining olive oil. Lay the dough on top and stretch and pat out until it reaches 10-by-16-inches, an oval rough shape is ideal. Use your fingertips to press in small indentations. Sprinkle evenly with the cherry tomatoes, sea salt and rosemary leaves. Let rise again for 20 minutes. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice into wedges or squares for serving and drizzle with more olive oil, if desired. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cup heavy cream 
 3/4 cup creme fraiche 
 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 
 12 eggs 
 1 cup mixed vegetables 
 1 tablespoon canola oil 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Make the frittata base by mixing together the heavy cream, creme fraiche, Parmesan, salt, white pepper and eggs. Set aside in the fridge. At Craftsman and Wolves, we like to use fresh seasonal vegetables in our frittata. However, the wonderful thing about this dish is you can use whatever is in your fridge. Start by either sauteing or roasting your vegetables. If you are sauteing, you can use the same pan to cook the frittata. If you have leftover vegetables, make sure to thoroughly warm them in your frittata pan before adding the egg mixture. This will keep the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan when you serve the frittata. Once your vegetables are cooked, set a 9-inch pan over medium-high heat. Evenly coat the canola oil around the sides and bottom of your pan. When the oil starts to smoke a little, turn down the heat to medium and add your vegetables so that they form a even layer on the bottom of your pan. After 1 minute, add your frittata mixture. It should sizzle up the side of the pan. Turn your heat down to medium-low and let the frittata cook. Once the edges of the frittata are set, transfer to the oven and cook just until the center is set, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow the frittata to cool for 5 minutes, and then run a butter knife around the side to loosen it from the pan. Invert onto a cutting board and cool 10 minutes. Re-flip the frittata onto a plate, cut into 4 to 6 slices and serve! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 cups steak seasoning spice 
 1 cup brown sugar 
 8 pounds bone-in beef short ribs 
 Oil, for searing ribs 
 15 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 
 8 red onions, roughly chopped 
 5 carrots, roughly chopped 
 12 3/4 cups beer 
 8 1/2 cups cola 
 6 1/3 cups white vinegar 
 2 cups granulated sugar 
 6 large carrots, cut into julienne 
 4 large red onions, thinly sliced 
 12 large, firm romaine or iceberg lettuce leaves, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 For the short ribs: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, mix together the steak spice and brown sugar and then coat the short ribs with the mixture. In a large skillet, heat some oil over high heat until hot. Sear the ribs to create a crispy outer coating. Place the ribs in a large roasting pan and set aside. In the same skillet, cook the garlic, onions and carrots over medium-high until the vegetables have sweated, 10 to 15 minutes. Add a bit of the beer to deglaze the pan. Pour the vegetables over the ribs in the roasting pan. Add the rest of the beer, the cola and about 4 cups water to the roasting pan and make sure the meat is completely submerged. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for about 2 hours. Remove the cover and continue cooking an additional hour. For the pickled carrots and onions: Meanwhile, in a large pot, whisk together the vinegar, granulated sugar and 12 3/4 cups water until the sugar is completely dissolved. Bring to a boil, then let cool slightly. Put the carrots and onions in the quick pickling liquid for about 1 1/2 hours. Refrigerate. When the short ribs are done, remove from the juices and set aside. Strain the liquid and then place in a pan and reduce over low heat to use as a jus for the ribs. Scoop the short ribs into the lettuce cups and drizzle with a small amount of jus. Top with the pickled carrots and onions. Serve 2 lettuce wraps per person. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 Pizza dough, recipe follows 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 large artichoke hearts, very thinly sliced 
 1 1/2 cups fresh porcini, sliced if large 
 Salt 
 Freshly ground pepper 
 2 tablespoons chile oil 
 1 cup grated Italian Fontina 
 2 cups grated mozzarella 
 2 tablespoons chopped garlic, blanched 
 3 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, plus 4 sprigs for garnish 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 
 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 
 1 teaspoon honey 
 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees F 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing 
 Instructions: 
 Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. Preheat the oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place a large saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and when it is hot, saute the artichoke hearts and mushrooms. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Pour off any excess oil and let the vegetables cool. Roll or stretch the dough, 1/4 at a time, into a 9-inch circle. Place the dough, one at a time, on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the circles to within 1-inch of the edge with chili oil. For each calzone, put 1/4 of both cheeses on half of the dough, still leaving the 1-inch border. Top with 1/4 of the artichokes and mushrooms, the garlic and the thyme. Assemble the remaining calzones in the same way. Moisten the edges of the circles with water. Fold the un-topped half of the dough, trapping as much air inside as possible, over the filling and press the edges together firmly to seal. With the backside of a fork, press the edges of the dough to crimp them. Slide the calzones onto the pizza stone and bake about 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Brush the calzones with melted butter and sprinkle them with Parmesan. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Yield: 4 (8-inch) pizzas <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 7 1/2 to 8 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus softened butter for brushing 
 2 cups whole milk, at room temperature 
 2 large eggs, at room temperature 
 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 
 Instructions: 
 Bloom the yeast. Measure out 1/2 cup warm water and check the temperature: It should be between 110 degrees F and 120 degrees F (comfortable bathwater temperature). Sprinkle the yeast into a large bowl, add the warm water and whisk in the sugar. Let sit 1 minute (it should bubble and froth slightly), then gently stir in 1 cup flour. Set aside near the stove while you prepare the dough. Make the dough. Mix the melted butter and milk in a mixer with the hook attachment on low speed. Add the eggs and mix until blended. Scrape in the yeast mixture and mix until incorporated. Add 6 1/2 cups flour and 1 tablespoon salt; mix until the dough forms a ball, 2 to 3 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if the dough is too wet and sticky. Let it rise. Brush a large bowl with softened butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place, 2 hours to 2 hours, 30 minutes. The dough should double in volume. Shape the dough. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dust a clean flat surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Flour your hands; gently press the dough into a 16-by-8-inch rectangle, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick (don't use a rolling pin). Cut the dough. With the short side in front of you, cut the dough in half lengthwise with a floured knife. Then slice crosswise into 12 strips. Shape the dough. One at a time, fold each strip of dough unevenly in half so the top part slightly overlaps the bottom half, then tuck the overhang underneath. Place the rolls seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet in 3 tightly packed rows. (If making in advance, wrap the baking sheet tightly in plastic wrap and freeze up to 3 weeks.) Bake the rolls. Bake until the rolls are bursting at the seams and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. (If frozen, bake 25 minutes at 325 degrees F, then 10 minutes at 375 degrees F.) Remove from the oven and brush with softened butter. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately. Photographs by Jim Franco <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 pounds skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat 
 1 recipe Ancho Chili Powder, recipe follows 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 6 ripe yet firm peaches, halved and pitted 
 3 limes, cut into 1/4-inch slices 
 4 cups micro greens or baby mixed greens 
 1 cup toasted pecans 
 3 ancho chiles, seeded and hand-torn into pieces 
 2 tablespoons chili powder 
 2 tablespoons ground coriander 
 1 tablespoon ground cumin 
 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 
 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
 1 tablespoon garlic powder 
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Lay the steak out on a large platter or piece of plastic wrap and rub both sides with the Ancho Chili Powder. Marinate for 1 hour so the flavors can penetrate the meat. In the meantime, place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep food from sticking. Rub the peaches with oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the peaches cut-side down on the grill and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until the flesh softens slightly and caramelizes. Turn them over with tongs and grill the other side for 3 minutes to char the skin; remove to a platter. Grill the lime slices for 2 minutes each side until slightly charred. Scrape off the excess chili powder on the surface of the steak so it doesn't burn on the grill. Rub the steak with oil and season both sides with of salt and pepper. Grill the steak on the hottest part of the barbecue for 4 minutes per side, until well charred. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut the meat across the grain on the diagonal. To serve: put the greens on a platter and arrange the peach halves, lime slices, and steak on top. Sprinkle with the pecans and drizzle the salad with the olive oil. This homemade chili powder will add a smoky depth to chili and as a dry rub for steaks. Toast the ancho chile pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don't scorch. Put the chiles in a mini food processor and pulse to a powder. Add the remaining ingredients and buzz again to combine. <|endoftext|>

Continue with the mixer on the lowest speed and add the flour mixture and cocoa mixture, alternating between the two, beginning and ending with the flour. Fill the prepared liners half full with the batter and bake for 30 minutes. Cool. For the ganache: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the porter beer to 130 degrees F. Pour the beer over the white chocolate in a clean medium bowl. Whisk until incorporated. Transfer the ganache into a sauce bottle for use. Hold at room temperature until the cupcakes are cooled. For the caramel corn crunch: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat your peanut butter and milk chocolate for 30 second increments until melted. Stir with a spoon between heating. Crush the caramel corn in a food processor until fine. Pour the chocolate mixture over the caramel corn. Stir with a spoon until incorporated. Chill in the refrigerator until set. Scoop with a number 70 ice cream scoop on to a plate lined with waxed paper. Reserve at room temperature until assembly. For the meringue: Combine the sugar and egg whites in a saucepan. Whisking constantly over low heat, bring the mixture to 110 degrees F. Pour the egg mixture into a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Whip until it reaches room temperature; the mixture should be light, fluffy and shiny. Add the vanilla extract and salt. This recipe should be done just prior to assembly. To assemble: Push the caramel corn filling into the middle of each porter cupcake. Fill in the hole with the porter ganache. Chill until set. Fill a piping bag fitted with a star tip half full with the meringue. Pipe on top of the cupcake. Toast the meringue with a kitchen torch. Garnish with caramel corn. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 to 3 quarts low-sodium chicken stock or broth 
 1 3-pound chicken, trussed 
 1 1/4 cups matzo meal 
 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 5 large eggs (3 separated) 
 1/4 cup melted chicken fat (schmaltz) or vegetable oil 
 1/4 cup minced onion 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, for forming the matzo balls 
 4 large sprigs dill 
 4 large sprigs parsley 
 1 large carrot, thinly sliced 
 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced 
 1 small onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice 
 1/4 pound rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Make the stock. In a large pot, bring 2 quarts chicken stock to a simmer. Add the chicken and return just to a simmer. Cover the chicken with a small heatproof plate to keep it submerged (add more stock if needed). Cover the pot and reduce the heat; gently simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken and let cool slightly, then roughly cut up the meat and set aside; discard the skin and bones. Strain the stock into another large pot. Skim the fat off the surface of the stock using a spoon. Make the batter. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the matzo meal, granulated garlic, baking powder, baking soda, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs with the 3 yolks, schmaltz and minced onion. In a separate clean bowl, beat the 3 egg whites with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Stir the schmaltz mixture into the dry ingredients, then stir in one-third of the beaten egg whites until incorporated. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites until no streaks remain. Form the matzo balls. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. In a small bowl, combine the vegetable oil with 1 tablespoon water. Using the oil-and-water mixture to keep your hands moist, roll scoops of batter (about 2 tablespoons each) into balls, handling them as gently as possible (makes 8 to 12). Arrange on the baking sheet and refrigerate 20 minutes so the outsides dry slightly. Make the soup. Tie the dill and parsley sprigs together with kitchen string. Return the chicken stock to a simmer. Add the carrot, celery, diced onion, rutabaga and herb bundle; season with salt and pepper. Return to a simmer and add the matzo balls. Cover and cook over moderate heat, turning the matzo balls a few times, until they are plump and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Stir the chicken into the soup and cook until just warmed through. Remove the herb bundle and season the soup with salt and pepper. Photograph by David Malosh <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 whole chicken, cut up into 8 pieces 
 Handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 
 2 to 3 slices lemon 
 2 bay leaves 
 Salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1 tablespoon EVOO 
 6 large shallots, sliced 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 3 cups shelled fresh peas or defrosted frozen organic peas 
 1 large bunch spring carrots (3/4 to 1 pound), thinly sliced on an angle 
 3 tablespoons butter, plus more for the bread 
 Handful fresh dill, chopped 
 Baguette, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Place the chicken wings in a small saucepot and cover with water. Add the lemon and bay leaves, and sprinkle with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pat the remaining chicken pieces dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the EVOO in a deep skillet or wide Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, side-down, and cook until crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook, partially covered with a lid or foil, until cooked through, 8 to 10 more minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. Lower the heat a bit, then add the shallots and sugar to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom, and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain the poaching liquid and add 1 cup of it to the skillet. Add the peas, carrots and herbs, then stir in the butter and season with a little more salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the peas and carrots are tender, 6 to 7 minutes. If you are not serving the stew immediately, stop after you add the carrots and peas (do not simmer them). Arrange the chicken on top and cover. Cool and store in the refrigerator. To serve, removed the chicken to a broiler pan and crisp up under the broiler. Simmer the stew until the peas and carrots are tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Return the chicken to the stew. Ladle the stew into shallow bowls and top with the chicken. Serve with warm buttered baguette. Cook's Note: You can use store-bought chicken stock instead of the poaching liquid if you want to skip that step. <|endoftext|>

 Nonstick cooking spray 
 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided 
 1 pound fresh green beans, rinsed, trimmed and halved 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 12 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 
 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 1 cup chicken broth 
 1 cup half-and-half 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Combine the onions, flour, panko and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Coat a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray and evenly spread the onions on the pan. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes. Toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F. While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions. Place into the oven and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Bones from sole 
 1 cup fish stock 
 1 cup dry white wine 
 12 fillets of sole, totaling 1 3/4 pounds, rinsed, plus 1 more pound fillets, ground smooth for quenelles 
 1 cup cold water 
 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
 1 1/2 cups flour, sifted 
 1 egg and 2 egg whites, beaten together 
 Freshly ground salt 
 Freshly ground pepper 
 1 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

 Instructions: 
 In large saute pan, heat fish bones, fish stock, and wine. Add fillets and gently bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cover. Cook about 6 minutes or until done. Remove from pan to a plate, and cover with buttered paper to keep warm. Reserve poaching liquid. The quenelles: Meanwhile, in another pot, bring to boil the cold water with a pinch of salt. Stir in 1/4 cup of the butter, just to melt. Remove from heat and stir in flour. Beat thoroughly with a wooden spoon until the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pot. Let cool. Add egg and whites and mix well. Season ground sole with salt and white pepper. Add to pot with flour-egg mixture. Beat well. Gradually add 1/4 cup of cream. Place quenelle mixture in a pastry bag with a 1-inch plain nozzle or use teaspoons; see below. Add the apple slices, Calvados, and curry powder to the sole poaching liquid. Simmer over low heat. Add remaining 1 cup of the cream. Bring to a boil and reduce to a fast simmer. Pipe quenelle mixture directly into the poaching liquid pot or use 2 spoons to mold the mixture into oval shapes. Add the shrimp. Stir gently and poach for 3 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons beurre manie to thicken. Cook for another minute to lose any floury taste. To serve, cover fillets with the quenelles and some sauce. Combine flour and butter on a clean surface. Knead together well. This makes more than you'll need for the Sole. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 ounces semisweet or bitter sweet chocolate, chopped 
 1 cup flat cola 
 2 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 
 1 teaspoon fine salt 
 3 large eggs 
 2 cups sugar 
 3/4 cups vegetable oil 
 1 cup buttermilk 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 2 1/4 cups sugar 
 9 large egg whites 
 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 Pinch fine salt 
 1 1/4 pounds (5 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces 
 1/2 cup natural cocoa powder 
 2 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, melted 
 Football Sugar Cookies, homemade or store bought, recipe follows 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 1 large egg 
 1 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: Plastic goal posts, available a specialty baking stores For the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and line the bottom of 9 by 13-inch cake pan with parchment paper, overlapping on 2 sides to create flaps. Put chopped the chocolate in a bowl. Heat cola just to a simmer over low heat and pour over chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes; stir until smooth. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In another large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until slightly thickened and pale, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs. Beat on low until combined well, but not aerated. Add the flour mixture and continue to beat until just combined. (Stir lightly with a rubber spatula to remove any pockets of flour.) Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched, and a tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool cake completely in the pan on a rack. Run a knife around edge of the pan and invert cake onto a rack. Carefully remove parchment paper and cool completely. (The cake may be made in advance, tightly wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.) Whisk the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Generously flour a clean work surface. (Tip: for a nice, even layer of flour, sift flour over work station.) Roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, working quickly enough that the dough stays chilled. (If dough gets warm and soft, put it in refrigerator on a lined baking sheet to chill, about 30 minutes.) Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. (Excess dough can be gathered together, pressed into a disk, chilled and rerolled.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms and sides are barely golden, about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. <|endoftext|>

Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until golden and toasted, tossing the mixture around about halfway through, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheet, then store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup za'atar (Middle Eastern spice mix consisting of dried oregano, thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt) 
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 Lebanese Pita Dough, recipe follows 
 Labneh (strained yogurt) 
 Fresh tomatoes, sliced 
 Black olives 
 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 1/4 ounce (7g) package active dry yeast 
 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 
 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water 
 Olive oil, for drizzling 
 Instructions: 
 Mix the zaatar and olive oil in a bowl and set aside. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and lay a baking tray in the oven to heat. Cut the Lebanese Pita Dough into 12 pieces. Roll out the dough to 1/4- inch thick. Pinch the edges around the dough to form higher edges. Take a fork and pierce the dough all over, releasing any air pockets. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons za'atar (make sure you mix before using) over each pita dough. Place 3 to 4 pitas on the hot baking tray in the oven and close the door immediately, making sure to not overcrowd the baking tray or oven. Bake until golden on the bottom and a little golden on the top, about 5 minutes. Serve with labneh, tomatoes and black olives rolled inside. The perfect Lebanese breakfast! Sift the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar together. Make a well in the middle of the dry mixture. Pour in the lukewarm water. Mix by hand on a floured work surface until the dough comes together. Then knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes until smooth and the dough bounces back when you push into it. Drizzle the dough with olive oil and place in a warm spot covered with a damp towel. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, depending on the temperature, it could take 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups nonfat plain Greek yogurt 
 1 clove garlic, finely grated 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 
 8 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 
 1 large eggplant, quartered lengthwise 
 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
 8 baguette slices 
 3 medium tomatoes, quartered 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat a grill to medium high. Mix the yogurt, garlic, parsley and oregano in a bowl. In a separate bowl, toss the chicken with 1/4 cup of the yogurt mixture, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Stir the olive oil into the remaining yogurt mixture and set aside. Brush the cut sides of the eggplant with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and the smoked paprika. Brush the bread with olive oil. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Grill the chicken, turning once, until cooked through and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grill the eggplant, skin-side down, until softened, about 15 minutes; turn and continue cooking until tender, about 5 more minutes. Grill the tomatoes and bread, turning once, until marked, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the chicken, eggplant, tomatoes and bread with the yogurt sauce.

 Ingredients: 
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan 
 10 graham cracker sheets, broken in half 
 1 1 1/2-quart carton mango ice cream 
 1 1 1/2-quart carton black raspberry ice cream 
 1 1 1/2-quart carton strawberry ice cream 
 1/2 1 1/2-quart carton vanilla ice cream 
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
 1 to 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 
 Instructions: 
 Butter the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Cut a 26-by-7-inch piece of parchment paper and press the parchment strip around the inside of the pan so it extends above the rim (this will hold the cake in place as you build it up). Lock the springform ring to secure the paper to the base of the pan. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan and freeze until firm, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the carton of mango ice cream in half with a serrated knife. Return one half to the freezer and let the other half sit at room temperature, 5 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth and spreadable but not melted. Spread the mango ice cream evenly onto the crust with a small offset spatula. Freeze until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Repeat Step 3 with the black raspberry ice cream (half the carton) and freeze. (Rinse out the mixer bowl between each flavor.) When firm, repeat with strawberry ice cream. When firm, beat all of the vanilla ice cream and spread on top; freeze. Repeat the layers with the remaining mango, black raspberry and strawberry ice cream, making sure each layer is firm before adding the next. Freeze the cake until completely firm, at least 1 hour. Remove the springform ring and parchment. Beat the heavy cream with the confectioners' sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Spread on top of the cake and return to the freezer until firm, about 10 minutes. To make the ice cream easier to spread, we beat it in a stand mixer. If you don't have a mixer, just let the ice cream soften at room temperature. Photograph by Ryan Dausch <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 cups heavy cream 
 1 pint oysters and liquor, separated 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 
 1 teaspoon celery seed 
 1 1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce 
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves, chervil, or chives 
 Salt and pepper 
 Instructions: 
 In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring the heavy cream and oyster liquor from the oysters to a simmer. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the celery and a pinch of the salt and sweat for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion and continue cooking until translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add celery seed, hot pepper sauce, and oysters and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the edges of the oysters start to curl. Transfer the oysters to the carafe of a blender and add enough of the cream just to cover.* Puree until the mixture is smooth. Return the remaining cream to medium heat, add the pureed mixture, and cook until heated through. Just before serving, add the lemon juice, chopped herbs, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup baking powder 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 3 cups water 
 5 pounds lard 
 Chili powder, honey or powdered sugar, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Slowly add in the water, a little at a time, using a fork to blend until the mixture forms into dough. Knead the dough until all the lumps are gone about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest about 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt the lard in a Dutch oven over high heat. When it just begins to smoke, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it quickly rises to the top, the oil is hot enough to begin frying. Take a piece of dough and roll it into a golf ball-sized ball. Stretch the dough into a disk-like shape as you would a pizza dough. When you have a piece ready to go, carefully place the dough into the oil and let it brown on 1 side about 1 1/2 minutes and then turn it over to brown the other side for another 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the fry bread from the oil and let it drain on paper towels until cool. Enjoy fry bread by sprinkling it with chili, honey, or powdered sugar. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 large leg-thigh chicken quarters 
 10 cups water 
 4 ribs celery, 2 cut large and 2 diced 
 6 peeled carrots, 3 cut large and 3 diced 
 1 large Spanish onion, cut in half and each half in thirds 
 4 tablespoons kosher salt, or to taste 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1 tablespoon granulated garlic powder 
 4 cups chicken stock (1 box) plus more for canola oil 
 4 extra-large eggs 
 1/3 cup canola oil with enough chicken stock to bring it to a total of 1/2 cup liquid 
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon pepper 
 1 cup matzo meal 
 1/2 pound thin kosher egg noodles 
 Instructions: 
 Put the chicken in a large stock pot. Cover it with water. Add 2 celery ribs which have been roughly cut. Add the carrots which have also been roughly cut. Add the cut onion, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil and cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool. With a hand blender, puree the vegetables in the stock. Strain stock through a strainer into another stock pot to remove any bits. Add the box of stock to the new stock and put aside for later. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs. Add the stock and oil mixture and beat. Add the salt and pepper. Add the matzo meal and blend. Allow to sit on the counter for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken from the bones and dice into small pieces. Put aside with the rest of the diced celery and diced carrots. Bring the stock to a rapid boil. With a tablespoon, scoop matzo ball mixture into the boiling water 1 tablespoon at a time. If you want to roll it in a ball, oil your hands first to prevent the mixture from attaching to your hands. The balls will pop to the top of the stock. Add the chicken and vegetables and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the noodles and cover for another 5 minutes before serving. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 heads garlic 
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 3 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped 
 Grey salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature 
 1 loaf of good, crusty bread, cut into slices

Pour olive oil over them, and top with thyme springs. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap the foil tightly. Place in a small ovenproof pan, and bake until the cloves begin to pop out, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and cool. To remove the cloves, open the foil and squeeze the lower part of the head of garlic. In a small bowl, mash the cloves to form a paste. (At this point the paste can be used or stored in the refrigerator or freezer.) Add butter and chopped thyme to the bowl, stirring to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Toast both sides of the bread, using a hot grill, grill pan, or broiler. Spread the roasted garlic butter paste onto the toasted bread. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate 
 1 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 3/4 cup whole milk 
 8 scoops vanilla ice cream 
 8 scoops chocolate ice cream 
 Various sprinkles, chocolate chips, marshmallows, candies and pretzel pieces, for decorating 
 Scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, for serving 
 Whipped cream (in cans), for topping 
 Chocolate Butterscotch Caramel Bars or store-bought caramel brownies, broken into pieces, recipe follows 
 Caramel and strawberry sauces, for drizzling 
 Cherries, for topping 
 Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the pan 
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2 cups regular or quick oats 
 1 cup packed brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 3/4 sticks (14 tablespoons) cold salted butter, cut into pieces 
 Two 13.5-ounce cans dulce de leche (I used Nestle La Lechera) 
 About 1 cup Spanish peanuts 
 About 1 cup butterscotch chips 
 About 1 cup mini chocolate chips 
 Instructions: 
 For the ganache: Put the semisweet and bittersweet chocolate in a heatsafe bowl. Heat the cream until very hot in a saucepan and pour over the chocolate. Stir until melted and combined. Let cool. For the milkshake: Put the milk, vanilla and chocolate ice cream and 1 cup of the ganache in a blender and blend until combined. To assemble: Spoon some ganache into large mason jars and spread on the sides. Spread some ganache around the rim of the jars. Dip the rims in sprinkles, chocolate chips, marshmallows and/or candies, or press on pretzels. Add a scoop of ice cream to each glass and pour in the blended milkshake. Squirt whipped cream onto the top of each glass and add pieces of the bars or brownies. Now go crazy and decorate the top with more whipped cream, ice cream, candies, etc. Drizzle with caramel or strawberry sauce and top with a cherry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray. Mix together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and pat lightly to pack it slightly. Bake until light golden brown on top and done in the middle, watching to make sure it doesn't burn, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Spoon the dulce de leche into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave to just slightly soften it, about 45 seconds. Scoop it on top of the oatmeal base and use an offset spatula to spread it out to the edges and into an even layer. Sprinkle on a layer of peanuts so that they completely cover the caramel and use your hands to gently press them into the caramel. Sprinkle on the butterscotch chips and mini chocolate chips in generous layers. Note: The warmth of the cookie base and caramel should slightly soften the butterscotch and chocolate chips. When that happens, use your hands to very gently press the chips just enough to anchor them together (but not enough to misshape them). If the pan isn't warm enough, pop it into the oven for 30 seconds or so and gently press the chips to anchor them together. Chill the bars for 2 to 3 hours to make them easy to slice. Remove them from the pan, place on a cutting board and use a long serrated knife to cut into small squares (they're rich!). Serve cold or at room temperature. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus extra at room temperature for greasing the baking dish 
 1 head broccoli, cut into florets 
 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets 
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 cups half-and-half 
 2 cups shredded sharp white Cheddar, divided 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking dish with butter and add the broccoli and cauliflower. Roast until slightly browned, about 15 minutes. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter, whisk in the flour and let it cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn the heat off, whisk in the half-and-half, then turn the heat up to high and keep whisking to avoid the flour from clumping. Add the Cheddar, salt and pepper and whisk until the cheese is melted. Remove the broccoli and cauliflower from the oven and pour the Cheddar mixture over the top. Sprinkle evenly with the breadcrumbs and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups carrot juice 
 1/2 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth 
 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1 medium shallot, finely chopped 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces 
 8 (3-inch) sprigs fresh marjoram, tied together with kitchen twine 
 1 1/2 pounds large sea scallops (about 12) 
 Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 
 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil 
 Instructions: 
 In a medium saucepan, combine carrot juice, 1/4 cup wine, lemon juice, shallot, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat just enough to maintain a steady boil and cook until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1/2 cup. It should be the consistency of pulpy orange juice, 20 to 30 minutes. Reduce heat and very gently simmer carrot reduction. Whisk in butter 1 piece at a time, waiting until each piece is melted and incorporated before adding another. The sauce should be thickened enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon. Return the sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly. Drop in and submerge the bundle of marjoram and remove from the heat. Let marjoram infuse sauce while cooking the scallops. Heat oven to 175 degrees F. Turn off the oven and put in a platter to warm. If the scallops have a small, loosely attached, rectangular piece of white muscle on their sides, pull it off and discard it. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels and season all sides lightly with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saute pan over high heat until it is very hot and smoking. Using tongs, carefully place the scallops flat side down in the pan. Let the scallops cook undisturbed until they are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook until the other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer scallops to warmed platter. Reduce heat to medium and pour in remaining 1/4 cup wine. Scrape up browned bits, then add liquid to carrot mixture. Remove marjoram bundle from carrot sauce, squeeze it dry, and discard. Reheat sauce over medium heat, whisking constantly. Taste and adjust seasoning. For a very smooth texture, pass sauce through a very fine strainer. If there is a problem with sauce separating or butter coming to surface in droplets, blend it with an immersion blender for a few seconds. Divide scallops among warmed dinner plates and pour carrot sauce around them. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 I pound fresh yuca, peeled and diced into large pieces 
 1/2 cup scallion, chopped 
 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 
 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 
 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 
 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 red onion, thinly sliced 
 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
 1 teaspoon dry Mexican oregano

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound shrimp 
 1 pound minced turkey or minced pork 
 8 scallions 
 1 red pepper 
 4 ounces Chinese mushrooms, soaked in water 20 minutes 
 1 small piece ginger 
 8-ounce can water chestnuts 
 1/2 Chinese medium sized cabbage 
 1 tablespoon dry sherry 
 3/4 tablespoon white vinegar 
 1 tablespoons soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, or to taste 
 2 teaspoons molasses 
 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, or Chinese chili paste (optional) 
 1 tablespoon oil 
 Oil, for deep frying 
 100 spring roll wrappers 
 2 tablespoons cornflour 
 1 bowl of water, half full 
 1 damp clean hand or kitchen towel 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: 1 damp clean hand or kitchen towel Wood chopsticks Shell and de-vein shrimp, and put into food processor. Add minced meat, finely chopped scallions, finely chopped red pepper, finely chopped mushrooms, grated ginger, chopped water chestnuts, shredded cabbage, sherry, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, salt, curry powder, molasses, chili powder and process slowly only until shrimp is coarsely chopped in the food processor and watching closely not to over process shrimp. In a wok, or heated saute pan, add tablespoon of oil and saute mixture until 3/4 cooked, on high heat about 3 to 4 minutes, tossing mixture around in pan constantly. Prepare work area. Clean a surface and place bowl of water with cornflour mixed in, damp towel, spring roll wrappers, and partially cooked turkey mixture in work area. Start wrapping spring rolls by placing one wrapper at a time down on flat surface in at a diamond angle to you. Fill about 2 tablespoons of mixture starting a little above the bottom point of the wrapper. Dip fingers in the water bowl and moisten the top and sides of the wrapper. Start at the bottom tip and fold wrapper over turkey mix, rolling the mix into the wrapper half way. Then fold sides inward and continue rolling, sealing with more water if necessary on top. Continue to fold one at a time, keeping the finished ones moist under the moist clean towel (the towel should not be dripping wet, just moist to the touch). Time to Fry! In a deep frying pot, fill halfway with corn or vegetable oil. Heat until when wood chopsticks are placed in to touch the bottom, there are fast streams of bubbles streaming to the top (yes, that's the way my mother taught me!). Very important: before placing spring rolls in oil, make sure they are dry on the outside (if your towel was too damp, you must dry off the rolls in paper towel first, otherwise the oil will pop). Place spring rolls in a few at a time making sure to keep them separated while frying. If the oil is too hot, the outside will cook too quickly, leaving the inside undercooked -- adjust the temperature so that each spring roll takes about 5 to 7 minutes each to cook through and are golden brown. Drain and serve immediately. Excellent when served with your favorite dipping sauce. Try a sweeter sauce with spring rolls such as a plum or duck sauce. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 5 ounces mascarpone (about 2/3 cup) 
 2 tablespoons small brined capers, rinsed 
 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives 
 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3/4 pound smoked salmon, cut into 24 thin slices, 2 to 3 inches on the short side (presliced salmon is fine) 
 48 small tender arugula leaves 
 Instructions: 
 Mix the mascarpone with 1 tablespoon of the capers, 1 tablespoon of the chives, and the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Lay the salmon slices out on a cutting board so that they are all arranged with a short side facing you, with plenty of space above and below each slice. (If necessary, fill and roll the slices in batches). Put a spoonful of the mascarpone mixture on the narrow end of 1 slice. Lay 2 arugula leaves, fanned slightly apart, across the mascarpone, so that the tips of the leaves will project several inches from one end of the roll, and roll up the salmon. Stand the roll upright, the arugula leaves pointing upward, on a platter large enough to hold all 24 rolls. Repeat the process with the remaining slices. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Remove from the refrigerator, sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon each capers and chives, and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, shelled, deveined 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 4 teaspoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces 
 1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated peeled fresh ginger 
 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest 
 10 mint leaves, julienned 
 10 basil leaves, julienned 
 Instructions: 
 Divide the shrimp between two 8- or 9-inch pie pans and pat them completely dry with a paper towel. Arrange the shrimp so they lay flat and are evenly spaced in the pans. Heat 2 large skillets over medium heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper; add a teaspoon of butter to each pan and turn the heat to high. When the foam subsides, invert a pie pan of shrimp over the skillet so they fall into the pan all at once. Repeat with the other pan of shrimp. Cook the shrimp, undisturbed, until they turn golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Add a remaining teaspoon of butter to each pan and turn off the heat. Turn the shrimp over with tongs and cook for 1 minute in the residual heat of the pans. Add half the ginger, lime juice and zest, mint, and basil to each pan, and shake to combine. Divide the shrimp among 4 plates or a serving platter and serve hot or at room temperature. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 pound jalapeno peppers (about 6 large) 
 1 small onion 
 6 garlic cloves 
 2 cups apple cider vinegar 
 1/2 bunch cilantro 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 lime, juiced 
 Instructions: 
 Remove the tops from the peppers and cut them in half lengthwise. Clean out the seeds and ribs, give them a rough chop, and put them into a small saucepan. Roughly chop the onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Pour in the vinegar and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. In the meantime, roughly chop the cilantro and put it into a blender along with the salt and lime juice. When the jalapeno mixture is cooked, add it to the blender. *Cover the blender, put a towel over the lid, and turn it on low. Once it is going, crank it up to the highest setting and puree for 3 minutes. Strain through a medium holed strainer and let cool. Pour into sterilized bottles and refrigerate. The hot sauce will keep for up to a month under refrigeration. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 6 small russet potatoes (6 to 8 ounces each) 
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 6 ounces kielbasa, diced 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 4 cups coleslaw salad mix 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 4 scallions, chopped, 3 tablespoons of the sliced greens reserved for garnish 
 2 cups shredded mozzarella 
 About 1/2 cup barbecue sauce 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Poke the potatoes, place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and rub all over with the olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bake until a paring knife easily pierces the flesh, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly. Put the kielbasa in a large skillet with the veggie oil and then turn the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat starts to render, and the sausage is golden in places, about 5 minutes. Add the coleslaw mix and stir until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick wall of potato and skin so they hold their shape. Add the potato flesh to the bowl with the kielbasa mixture and stir in the butter, scallions, 1 cup of the mozzarella, 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce and 1 teaspoon salt. Season with salt and pepper. Put the potato boats on the baking sheet and spoon the filling into them. Sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the tops. Bake until the cheese is melted and the tops are browned in spots, about 20 minutes. Brush with the remaining barbecue sauce, top with the reserved scallions and serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 yeast cakes 
 1/2 cup warm water 
 2 cups warm, nonfat milk (or scalded whole milk slightly cooled) 
 5 pounds flour 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 dozen fresh eggs, room temperature 
 3 1/2 cups sugar 
 3 tablespoon lemon juice 
 1/2 pound butter, melted 
 2 tablespoons salt 
 1 egg, beaten 
 Instructions: 
 Dissolve 3 yeast cakes in 1/2 cup warm water, (not hot). Add 2 cups warm, nonfat milk (or scalded whole milk slightly cooled) and 3 cups flour, and 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk together and set aside to proof yeast. In a separate bowl, add 1dozen fresh eggs, sugar, and lemon juice. Beat well and then add melted butter. Add yeast mixture, the remaining flour and 2 tablespoons of salt. Mix well and let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. Continue mixing until dough begins to pull away from bowl or knead with greased hands until dough pulls away from your hands. This takes a while and the dough is sticky unlike bread dough. Place in greased bowl and cover to let rise to double, about 1 to 3 hours. Punch down, turn over, and let rise to double a second time. Carefully break away about 2/3 pound of dough at a time, rolling dough into a nice loaf shape and place into greased loaf pans. This should make about 5 to 7 nice loafs. Let rise until double in the pans for a third rising. Make two to three 1/4-inch slits on the top of each loaf and then brush tops with 1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water. Bake at 325 degrees F for about 10 minutes and then reduce heat to about 300 degrees F for another 25 to 30 minutes. Remove loaves from the oven and lay them on their side on a rack for a couple of minutes before removing from the pan. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 to 5 cups mixed raspberries and quartered strawberries 
 1/2 cup sugar, divided 
 2 tablespoons amaretto, or to taste 
 3 large egg yolks 
 2 tablespoons dry Marsala 
 1/2 cup chilled heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl, mix together the berries, 1/4 cup sugar, and amaretto. Set aside to macerate for 15 minutes or up to 1 hour at room temperature. Meanwhile, make the zabaglione: Set an instant-read thermometer in a cup of hot water. In a metal bowl, with a whisk or a hand-held electric mixer, beat together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala until well combined. Set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and beat mixture until tripled in volume and thermometer registers 140 degrees F, about 5 minutes. To ensure that eggs are cooked, beat mixture 3 minutes more. Set the bowl in a bowl of ice water and continue beating until chilled. In another bowl, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks. In 3 additions, fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione and store in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, divide the fruit among stemmed glasses or bowls and spoon the chilled zabaglione over the top. Serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast 
 Pinch of sugar 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling 
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
 3 1/4 cups bread flour 
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
 Fine sea salt 
 One 3 1/2-pound pork loin roast, fat cap left on 
 3 tablespoons black peppercorns 
 5 tablespoons butter 
 6 cloves garlic, finely grated 
 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 1 cup mayonnaise, such as Kraft Homestyle 
 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Pinch of salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1 clove garlic, finely grated 
 Zest and juice of 1 lemon (2 tablespoons juice) 
 3 ounces Parmesan, shaved thinly 
 2 cups arugula 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the flatbread: Combine the yeast, sugar and 1/4 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl and let the yeast puff up and proof. Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl and add 1 cup lukewarm water, the oil and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour and whisk until smoothly combined. Switching to a wooden spoon, add the rest of the flour and stir until you have a soft dough. Rub the dough with a bit more oil, press a square of plastic wrap to its surface and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, transfer it to an oiled plastic bag and let it proof in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or as long as 3 days. For the peppered pork loin: To give the roast a quick cure for added flavor, stir together the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt, rub the mixture all over the roast and refrigerate for 1 hour or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Blot the roast dry. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle (or in a spice-devoted coffee grinder) to a medium-coarse texture. (Some will be finely ground, but you want the larger pieces to resemble cracked pepper.) Rub the pepper into the meat, saving what doesn't stick for the marinade. Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat, and add the butter and garlic. Cook until the butter bubbles; add the vinegar, thyme and remaining black pepper, and remove from the heat. Sprinkle the pork with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to fit the pork roast over high heat and add the oil. Brown the meat quickly on all sides. Brush the meat generously with some of the pepper mixture, put the skillet in the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the skillet, roll the roast to another side and baste it with more of the pepper mixture. Continue to roast the meat, removing it from the oven every 10 minutes or so to flip and mop, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 145 degrees F, about 50 minutes total. Transfer the meat to a platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes, rolling the pork around to sop up its exuded juices. Refrigerate the pork until using. (The pork could also be sliced and served hot at this point.) For the doctored aioli: Stir together the mayonnaise, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon zest and juice in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until using. Heat a grill over high heat. Generously oil a baking sheet. Divide the flatbread into eight portions on the baking sheet. Press the dough into thin rounds, about 8 inches in diameter. Grill the breads over medium-high heat, closing the lid right after putting them on and flipping and turning to avoid any flare-ups. Each flatbread will take about 2 minutes to cook. Slice the pork very thinly. Spread some aioli across the flatbreads and pile some pork on one side of each. Top with shaved Parmesan and a handful of arugula. Fold the sandwiches in half and pile them on a platter for serving. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, plus extra for greasing 
 4 ounces plain yogurt 
 3 1/2 ounces gram flour (chickpea flour) 
 1 to 2 thin green chiles, seeds removed 
 1 (1/4-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled 
 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 6 tablespoons water, divided 
 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 
 Kosher salt 
 2 teaspoons sugar, divided 
 3/4 teaspoon Eno's fruit salts* or baking powder 
 1 teaspoon mustard seeds* 
 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds 
 12 curry leaves* 
 Handful chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish 
 Handful freshly grated coconut, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Grease a 7-inch cake pan with vegetable oil. In a bowl, whisk the yogurt and the gram flour together to a smooth batter. In a food processor, blend the green chiles, ginger, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water to a smooth paste. Add the chile paste, turmeric, salt, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar to the batter, and stir until well combined. Loosen the batter if necessary with a teaspoon of water to return it to the consistency of heavy cream. Add the fruit salts, and stir well to combine, then set aside for 4 to 5 minutes. Fill the saucepan of an 8-inch double boiler with water and bring to a boil. (Alternatively, place a biscuit cutter of the same size or an upturned heatproof bowl into a large, heavy-based pan and pour enough water into the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the bowl. Cover the pan with a lid and bring the water to a boil.) Pour the batter into the greased cake pan and carefully lower it into the double boiler. Cover the pan with a lid and steam the cake over a medium heat for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the batter comes out clean. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and fry for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the mustard seeds start to pop. Be careful of the popping seeds and splatter of oil. When the mustard seeds have started to pop, add the sesame seeds and curry leaves and fry for another minute, or until the sesame seeds are golden brown. Discard the curry leaves. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of water and the remaining teaspoon of sugar and boil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture resembles syrup. To serve, turn out the lentil cake onto a serving plate. Pour the syrup evenly over the cake. Sprinkle over the fresh coriander and coconut. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 shiitake mushroom caps

 2 cups warm white beans, cooked or canned rinsed and drained and heated 
 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 
 3 tablespoons chopped chives 
 3 plum tomatoes, finely diced 
 4 tablespoons lemon juice 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
 Instructions:

 Ingredients: 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 1 teaspoon fine white pepper 
 1 teaspoon sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon five spice powder 
 2 (14 ounce/400 g each) live crabs, blue swimmer or mud crab 
 Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 
 Potato starch, for dusting 
 3 red Asian shallots, finely diced 
 2 cloves garlic, finely diced 
 3 spring onions (scallions), cut into 2-inch/5 cm lengths 
 2 long red chiles, thinly sliced on the diagonal 
 Serving suggestion: Jasmine rice. 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: cleaver For the seasoning mix: In a bowl, mix salt, white pepper, sugar, and five spice pepper together. To prepare your crabs humanely, place them in the freezer for 1 hour to put them to sleep, or submerge them in an ice bath for 5 minutes. Remove the upper shell of the crab, pick off the gills, which look like little fingers, and discard them. Clean the crab under running water and drain. Place the crab on its stomach and chop the crab in 1/2 with a heavy cleaver. Now chop each 1/2 into 4 pieces, chopping each piece after each leg. With the back of the cleaver gently crack each claw - this makes it easier to extract the meat. Heat the oil in a wok to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C, or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil browns in 5 seconds. Dust the crab pieces with potato starch, shaking off the excess. Deep-fry the crab in batches for 3 minutes, turning over once, until golden brown. Remove from the wok and drain on kitchen paper towels. Remove the oil, reserving 2 tablespoons, and clean the wok. Heat the reserved oil in the wok, then add the shallots and garlic and fry until fragrant. Return the crab to the wok and toss all ingredients together well, adding the salt and pepper seasoning mix to taste. Serve with jasmine rice and finger bowl. <|endoftext|>

 In a large saucepan, bring seafood stock to a boil. Once boiling, add salt, bay leaves, and lobster meat. Cook lobster only until it is opaque. Do not overcook lobster as it will get tough. Remove lobster with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain, reserving cooking liquid. Remove bay leaves from liquid and discard.; Melt the butter in a saucepan, and add garlic and scallions, cooking them until they become tender. Stir in the grits, and toast lightly in the pan, then add the cooking liquid from the lobster and simmer until the grits are cooked, about 20 minutes. (The grits should be fluffy.) While the grits are cooking, cook bacon in a large skillet until crispy and golden brown, then remove to paper toweling to drain. Pour off most of the fat from the pan. To the same pan which now has a coating of bacon fat, add the mushrooms, onion, garlic, thyme, tomatoes, and parsley. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to integrate flavors, then return bacon pieces to pan and add white wine. Let wine reduce by half while grits are cooking. To finish, gently fold lobster, lime juice, and Parmesan into grits. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Transfer lobster grits to serving dish and spoon mushroom wine sauce around.

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
 1 cup dark Mexican beer* 
 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
 2/3 cup Mexican crema** or sour cream 
 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons water 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Oil, for frying 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 
 2 pounds skinned halibut cut into 5 by 1/2-inch strips 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Corn tortillas 
 2 cups shredded cabbage 
 2 cups tomatillo salsa (store-bought or homemade) for garnish, optional 
 Pickled jalapenos, for garnish, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the Beer Batter: Mix the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add in the beer while whisking. Set aside and let the batter rest for 15 minutes before using. For Cream Sauce: Add the mayonnaise and crema to a medium bowl. Whisk in the lemon zest, lemon juice and water. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper (can be made 3 days ahead, covered and refrigerated). For the Fish: In a large skillet, over medium heat, add enough oil to reach a depth of 1-inch. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F or when the end of a wooden spoon sizzles when inserted into the oil. On a large plate, combine the flour and salt. Season the fish pieces all over with salt and pepper and coat with the flour. Working in batches, dip the fillets in the beer batter and coat on both sides. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Make tacos with the tortillas and fish and top each with cream, shredded cabbage, tomatillo salsa and pickled jalapenos, if desired. *Cook's Note: Crack open a cold Mexican cerveza like a Negra Modelo or a 2 Equis (XX) Amber to make this tasty beer batter, which will change the way you think about fried fish! You can use it for vegetables, too. **Cook's Note: Mexican Crema is Mexico's version of creme fraiche and is found at many supermarkets and can easily be substituted with sour cream. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 1/4 tablespoon salt 
 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces 
 4 tablespoons cold lard, cut into 8 pieces 
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
 1/4 cup cream cheese, softened 
 3/4 cup farmers cheese, softened 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1 large egg yolk 
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 Small bunch red seedless grapes, halved 
 Instructions: 
 In a chilled mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, butter, and lard. Rub the flour and fat together with your fingertips until the mixture is flaky and the consistency of coarse bread crumbs. Drizzle half of the beaten egg over and toss until the dough comes together, adding the remaining egg if necessary to bind the dough. Gather the dough into a compact ball and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass, cut the dough into 3 1/2 inch rounds. Gather the scraps into a ball, re-roll them and cut more rounds. Repeat until you have used all the dough. Fit the dough rounds into ungreased 2 1/2 inch tart pans or the cups of a muffin pan, pressing them gently against the bottoms and sides to form deep molds. Place the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm the dough. Place the tins on a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Set the shells aside in their tins to cool. Reduce the oven to 350 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a handheld mixer, beat the cream cheese, farmers cheese, and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolk, cinnamon, and salt and beat until smooth. Spoon the filling into the tart shells, dividing it evenly, and filling up to within 1/4-inch of the top. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until the filling is set and doesn't jiggle when shaken. Cool the tarts to room temperature and carefully slip them out of their tins. Serve, garnished with a few grape halves. <|endoftext|>

 1 cup heavy cream 
 1/2 cup chicken stock 
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut the sweet potatoes and then the parsnips into paper-thin slices using a food processor fitted with the thinnest vegetable-slicing blade. If necessary, cut the potatoes in half or quarters lengthwise so they fit into the feeder tube. Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to coat the inside of a 2-quart oven-proof casserole (a 6 by 10-inch Pyrex pan works well). Combine the cream, stock, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Place 1/3 of the sweet potatoes in a thin layer across the bottom of the casserole. Layer half the parsnips on top of the sweet potatoes. Repeat this sequence until all of the sweet potatoes and parsnips have been used. Pour the cream mixture over the top. It should reach about 3/4 of the way up the vegetables. Butter a piece of aluminum foil with the remaining butter and wrap the foil tightly over the casserole. Put in the oven and turn tempertature down to 325 degrees. Bake the casserole 1 hour. Remove the foil and continue to cook another 15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender when pierced with a knife and the top is browned. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve warm. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1 teaspoon fine salt 
 3 sticks unsalted butter, cubed (keep cold in the freezer) 
 1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar 
 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 large onion, thinly sliced 
 Kosher salt 
 4 large red-skinned potatoes (1 1/2 pounds), unpeeled 
 2 gala apples, unpeeled 
 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 3 tablespoons breadcrumbs 
 5 ounces mortadella or ham, thinly sliced 
 10 ounces white cheddar cheese, shredded 
 Heavy cream, for brushing 
 Instructions: 
 Make the crust: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add 1 stick butter and pulse until combined. Add the remaining 2 sticks butter and pulse three times, or until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the vinegar, then gradually add 1/3 cup ice water through the feed tube, pulsing four times, until evenly combined. Squeeze the dough between your fingers. If it doesn't hold its shape, add up to 2 tablespoons ice water and pulse two more times (the dough should still be crumbly). Turn out onto a clean surface and press into a ball; divide in half, wrap in plastic wrap and flatten into two 1-inch-thick rectangles. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Make the filling: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until slightly brown, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and let cool. Slice the potatoes and apples very thinly; toss in a bowl with the thyme, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang on all sides. On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dough into a 12-inch square, about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to the prepared dish, tucking the dough into the edges and corners; do not trim the overhang. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the dough and add the onion. Lay the mortadella on top, then sprinkle with about one-third of the cheese. Layer half of the potatoes and apples on top in a single layer; Season with salt and pepper to taste, then sprinkle with another one-third of the cheese. Top with the remaining potatoes, apples; season again and finish with cheese. Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch square and place on top of the filling. Press the overhang of the two crusts together, then roll the dough under itself and pinch to make a 3/4-inch-high edge. Make slits in the top crust with a knife to allow steam to escape. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Bake the pie until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, brush the crust with cream and continue baking until crisp, about 35 more minutes. Cool 25 minutes, then lift out of the pan and slice.

 Ingredients: 
 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 
 1 pound ground beef 
 1/2 yellow onion, diced 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 1 ripe plum tomato (about 2 ounces), seeded, cored, and diced 
 1 tablespoon chili powder 
 2 teaspoons ground cumin 
 1 teaspoon dried oregano 
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 
 1 canned chipotle chile in adobo, minced, or 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder 
 1 teaspoon masa harina or cornmeal 
 Salt and black pepper 
 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 
 1 avocado, peeled and pitted 
 1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and finely diced 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 
 1 clove garlic, minced 
 Pinch of ground cumin 
 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice 
 Salt 
 Vegetable oil, for frying 
 4 corn tortillas, quartered 
 Salt 
 1/3 cup refried beans 
 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese 
 1 cup sour cream 
 2 whole pickled jalapenos, cut into 16 slices 
 Homemade or store-bought salsa, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 To make the chipotle taco meat, in a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the beef and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is lightly browned and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the gar lic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the tomato, chili powder, cumin, oreg ano, cayenne, and chipotle chile. Stir until the spices are well distributed, turn down the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the masa harina until well combined, then taste and adjust the seasonings. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Stir in the lime juice and remove from the heat. To make the guacamole, mash the avocado until smooth. Stir in the jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, cumin, and lime juice. Adjust seasonings and add salt to taste. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the nachos, pour 1/2 inch of oil into a heavy skillet and heat to 350 degrees F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, after 5 minutes of heating, you can stick a wooden spoon into the oil to see if it's ready. If the oil bubbles around the spoon, it should be hot enough. In batches, fry the tortillas for 1 minute, until golden brown, turning once. Drain on a paper towel and sprinkle lightly with salt. Place the chips close together but not overlapping on a baking sheet or cast-iron skillet, and top each with 1 teaspoon refried beans, 2 tablespoons chipotle taco meat, and 2 tablespoons cheddar cheese. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. After removing the nachos from the oven, top each with 1 tablespoon guacamole, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and 1 pickled jalapeno slice. Serve warm, with salsa on the side. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 3 teaspoons instant yeast 
 1 lemon, zested 
 1 orange, zested 
 1/3 cup plus 4 tablespoons whole milk 
 2 teaspoons vanilla 
 2 eggs 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 Oil, for frying 
 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted 
 1 tablespoon heavy cream 
 1 tablespoon rose water, orange blossom water or vanilla extract 
 Red food coloring, for coloring, optional 
 1/2 cup pistachios, finely ground 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: a doughnut cutter For the doughnuts: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add 3 cups of the flour, the sugar, yeast, lemon zest and orange zest, and mix for a couple seconds. In a small bowl, mix the milk, vanilla and eggs, and set aside. Turn the mixer on and alternate adding the milk mixture with the melted butter, scraping down the sides. Repeat for the remaining milk and butter, until it is all incorporated, then add the salt in. When you finish adding in all the liquids, the dough will be a little wet. Slowly sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup flour until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the mixing bowl almost clean. (If it reaches this stage before adding in the full 1/4 cup, do not add in the rest.) Turn the dough out and knead it on a floured surface until the dough is soft and comes together, 1 minute. Place the dough in a bowl with a little oil and cover with a damp cloth. Store in a warm place to proof until it doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours. Roll the dough out to 1/2- to 1-inch thick and cut into doughnut shapes. Place the doughnuts on a floured tray and cover with a damp cloth, let rise for another 30 to 40 minutes. While the dough is rising, heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. When the dough is fluffy and doubles in size, place it in the fryer for 2 minutes on each side. Take out the doughnuts and cool on a cooling rack. While the doughnuts are cooling, make the glaze. For the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar through a sifter into a bowl. Add the cream, rose water and a few drops food coloring if using, and mix. Set aside until the doughnuts are ready to be glazed. When the doughnuts are cool, place a tray underneath the cooling rack and then dunk the doughnuts in the icing for a nice thick layer. Sprinkle with a dusting of the ground pistachios then place on the rack to set. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted cake flour 
 2/3 cup sugar 
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 cup milk 
 1/4 cup cooking oil 
 2 egg yolks 
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
 2 egg whites 
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 Pastry cream, recipe follows 
 Ganache, recipe follows 
 2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 
 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped out 
 6 egg yolks 
 2/3 cup granulated sugar 
 1/4 cup cornstarch 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
 8 ounces semisweet chocolate 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium mixing bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add milk, oil, egg yolks, and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until combined. Beat an additional 3 minutes on high speed and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium to high speed until soft peaks form. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the egg white mixture and fold in. Gently pour the batter into a 9-inch greased pie pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Invert the pan onto a wire rack. Cool completely. Pastry Cream Filling: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. (The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Refrigerate until 1 hour before using.) Ganache: In a medium bowl, pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate and stir until melted. To assemble pie, remove the cake from the pan. Cut the cake in half horizontally. Place bottom layer on a serving plate or board, and spread with the pastry cream. Top with second cake layer. Pour chocolate ganache over and down the sides of the cake. Store in refrigerator. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup (4 ounces) goat cheese, at room temperature 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Vegetable oil cooking spray 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 large leek (white and light green part only), thinly sliced 
 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 
 2 pounds medium asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Special equipment: a 1/2-ounce cookie or ice cream scoop 
 Instructions: 
 Goat cheese: Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. Using a fork, in a small bowl, combine the goat cheese and basil until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Using a 1/2-ounce cookie scoop or a round tablespoon measure sprayed with vegetable oil cooking spray, scoop the goat cheese into balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Soup: In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring constantly until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the broth, asparagus and basil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the asparagus is tender, about 15 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Keep the soup warm over low heat. To serve: Ladle the soup into shallow bowls and garnish with the herbed goat cheese. Cook's Note: The soup can also be pureed by ladling, in batches, into a food processor or blender and blended until smooth. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened 
 4 ounces jarred salsa (hot) 
 4 green onions, finely sliced 
 4 large flour tortillas 
 10 slices bacon, cut into small pieces and cooked till crisp 
 16 thin slices deli ham 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, salsa and onions until fully combined. Spread the tortillas with the mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch edge. Top each with bacon and ham, then roll into tight cylinders and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. Remove from fridge, discard the plastic wrap and cut each roll into 1-inch pieces, discarding the uneven ends (or eating them while preparing, like I did!). Each roll should yield eight pieces. If you like, before cutting, stick toothpicks in the rolls at 1-inch intervals; it makes serving a snap. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves 
 6 garlic cloves, smashed 
 1 teaspoon celery seed 
 2 teaspoons coarse salt, plus more to taste 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated black pepper 
 1 (3-pound) boneless rump roast, trimmed 
 1 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves coarsely chopped 
 1/4 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted 
 3 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 
 1 teaspoon prepared grated horseradish 
 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed 
 4 Kaiser or other crusty sandwich rolls 
 Instructions: 
 To prepare the roast: Line a broiler or roasting pan with aluminum foil. Place the beef on the foil and set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the cilantro, garlic, celery seed, salt, and pepper. Puree until the mixture is a smooth paste. Rub the cilantro-garlic paste all over the roast, covering it completely. Allow the roast to marinate for at least 10 minutes to 1 hour to absorb the flavors. Roast the beef for about 1 1/2 hours for rare or until an instant-read thermometer registers 125 degrees F. when inserted into the center. Cook for an additional 10 minutes for medium-rare or 20 minutes for medium doneness. Remove the roast from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to settle. While the roast rests, make the pesto. To prepare the pesto: In a food processor, combine the cilantro, pine nuts, garlic, horseradish, and salt. Puree until well combined. With the motor running, drizzle in 1/4 cup of oil. Process until smooth. Add additional oil, if needed, until a drizzling consistency is reached. To serve: Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the roast beef. Put a few slices of roast beef on the bottom of each sandwich roll. Drizzle the cilantro pesto directly on the beef. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 (3 to 5 pound) beef tenderloin, butt-end or tail-end cut 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/2 cup cream sherry 
 2 tablespoons steak seasoning (recommended: McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning) 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 
 3 sprigs fresh rosemary leaves 
 3 sprigs fresh thyme leaves 
 Spinach Stuffing, recipe follows 
 Serving Suggestion: Marinated and roasted red and yellow peppers, and green salad with Maple Balsamic Vinaigrette, recipe follows 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 pound frozen chopped spinach 
 4 cloves garlic, chopped 
 1 to 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 
 1/2 cup sweet sherry 
 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 
 1/2 cup grated Romano cheese 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 1 cup Dijon mustard 
 1/3 gallon balsamic vinegar 
 1/4 gallon white vinegar 
 1 1/2 gallons 10 percent salad oil 
 1/4 cup dried basil 
 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 
 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 
 1/4 gallon maple syrup 
 Instructions: 
 Trim and remove all silver skin and fat from the beef. Rub meat with the olive oil and then splash with sherry. Continuing to rub beef, then sprinkle the steak seasoning all over the meat. Cover beef on all sides with the fresh herbs, rubbing to coat. Place meat in a shallow pan and allow to rest for 30 minutes. Turn and pat beef with the marinade that has collected in the pan. Allow to rest for an additional 30 minutes. Heat the grill to 500 degrees F. With an 8-inch knife, carefully pierce the meat in the center of 1 end. Cut a hole through that side as far into the fillet as the knife will allow. Turn to the other end and repeat this process, until the hole extends all the way through the fillet. Open the hole like a tunnel, being careful not to break through to the outside of the fillet. Using only small amounts at a time, stuff the cooled Spinach Stuffing into the opening from 1 end to the other. Reduce grill temperature to 400 degrees F. Place the stuffed beef tenderloin on the grill and, turning every 5 to 7 minutes to avoid burning the herbs, cook to an internal temperature of 110 to 120 degrees F. Cooking time for a medium-rare tenderloin is approximately 20 minutes. Once the tenderloin is cooked to your liking and removed from the grill, allow to rest for 10 minutes. Slice into 1/2 to 1-inch medallions. If desired, serve on a bed of roasted marinated red and yellow peppers with a green salad of your choice tossed in Maple Balsamic Vinaigrette. Spinach Stuffing: Heat oil in a saute pan over high heat. Add frozen spinach, garlic, and red pepper flakes, and saute over high heat until the spinach has lost its moisture and is heated through, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Add sherry and cook for 2 minutes. Add bread crumbs and Romano cheese. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the ingredients combine into a soft-textured stuffing. If the stuffing seems too dry, add some additional sherry. If the stuffing seems too wet, add more bread crumbs. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper, to taste. Add all fresh herbs and mix gently. Allow to cool before stuffing into tenderloin. Mix the mustard with the vinegars. Add the oil and combine well. Add all the dry seasonings and mix together. Add the maple syrup and stir until combined. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients:

 Ingredients: 
 8 medium or 12 small beets 
 1/3 cup olive oil 
 1 large shallot, finely chopped 
 Juice of 1 lemon 
 Leaves from about 10 sprigs thyme 
 3 good pinches salt 
 10 grinds fresh black pepper 
 1 large bunch watercress 
 4 tablespoons cold goat cheese 
 Instructions: 
 Cook beets in water to cover until tender, about 40 to 45 minutes. Drain the beets and set aside to cool. For the dressing, whisk together olive oil, shallot, half the lemon juice, the thyme, salt and pepper. Set aside. While the beets are cooling, wash the watercress and trim the thicker stems from the leaves. Spread the trimmed watercress out over some paper towels to dry. When the beets are cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to peel off the beets skins, they should come off very easily. Cut the beets into quarters lengthwise and then those pieces in half crosswise. Place the beets and watercress in separate bowls. Divide the dressing between the 2 bowls. Toss the watercress and beets until evenly coated with the dressing. Spread the watercress out on a serving platter to make a bed for the beets. Crumble the cold cheese into the beets and toss gently. Spread the beets over the bed of watercress and sprinkle with remaining lemon juice. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 ounce package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast 
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 to 2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl proof the yeast with the sugar in 1/3 cup lukewarm water for 10 minutes, or until it is foamy. Stir in an additional 1/3 cup lukewarm water, oil, 2 cups flour, and salt and blend mixture until it forms a dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of the remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Alternatively, the dough may be made in a food processor. Proof the yeast as described above and in a food processor combine it with the remaining ingredients. Process the mixture until it forms a ball, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if it is too dry, or more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it is too wet, and knead the dough by processing it for 15 seconds. Put the dough, prepared by either method, in an oiled bowl and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk, and punch it down. The dough is now ready to be formed into pizzas. <|endoftext|>

 Pinch kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a large bowl, mix together all the slaw ingredients. Allow to sit in refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving. Serve alone or on top of sandwiches. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
 Pinch of kosher salt 
 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 Vegetable oil, for frying 
 4 8-to-10-inch flour tortillas, cut into wedges or strips 
 Granulated sugar, for coating 
 Instructions: 
 Make the sauce: Bring 1/4 cup water, the brown sugar and salt to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. (You can refrigerate the sauce, covered, up to 3 days; reheat before serving.) Make the sopaipillas: Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large deep skillet until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the tortillas, turning once, until bubbly and golden on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. (Return the oil to 350 degrees F between batches.) Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle both sides generously with granulated sugar. Drizzle with the chocolate sauce. Photograph by Yunhee Kim <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 
 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 
 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into pieces 
 1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening, chilled and cut into pieces 
 3 to 8 tablespoons ice water 
 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted 
 2 cups whole milk 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 1/4 cup cocoa powder 
 3 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 3 large eggs, separated 
 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 Pinch of fine sea salt 
 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted 
 Instructions: 
 For the beginner's pie crust: Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, 8 to 10 seconds. With the processor on pulse, add enough of the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together without being sticky or crumbly. Shape the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill until firm and the moisture has distributed evenly, about 30 minutes. Flour a clean work surface and a rolling pin. Place the dough disk in the center of the floured surface. Starting in the center of the dough, roll to, but not over, the upper edge of the dough. Return to the center, and roll down to, but not over, the lower edge. Lift the dough, give it a quarter turn and lay it on the work surface. Continue rolling, repeating the quarter turns, until you have a disk about 1/8 inch thick. Ease the pastry into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim 1 inch larger than the diameter of the pie plate; fold the overhanging pastry under itself along the rim of the plate. For a simple decorative edge, press the tines of a fork around the folded pastry. To make a fluted edge, using both your finger and thumb, pinch and crimp the folded dough. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes. To blind-bake the crust, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Crumple a piece of parchment paper, and then lay it out flat over the bottom of the pastry. Weight the paper with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice; this will keep the unfilled pie crust from puffing up in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the paper and weights. (You can reuse the rice or beans for blind-baking a number of times.) Return to the oven and bake the empty shell until a deep golden brown, about 10 more minutes (for 30 minutes total). For the filling and meringue: While the pie crust is warm, brush the bottom with the melted chocolate and set aside. In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of the milk and the granulated sugar. In a bowl, combine the remaining 1 cup of milk, the cocoa powder and flour and whisk thoroughly to combine. Heat the saucepan with the milk-sugar mixture over medium-high heat until simmering. Slowly add the milk-flour mixture and stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Add the egg yolks, whisking constantly, and heat until it returns to a boil. Once the mixture comes to a boil, immediately add the vanilla and remove it from the heat. Pour the mixture into the baked pie crust. Set aside to cool completely and set, about 2 hours at room temperature or 1 hour refrigerated. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. To make the meringue topping, place the egg whites in a nonreactive bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the cream of tartar and, using a hand-held mixer, whisk on high speed until foamy. Sift over the confectioners' sugar a little at a time and whisk until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks when the whisk is lifted. To finish the pie, spoon the meringue over the pie, making sure it touches the edges of the pie crust. Bake until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut the pie into wedges and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 pound ground pork 
 2 cups shredded cabbage (1/2 a 16-ounce package cole slaw mix) 
 A few pinches ground cayenne pepper 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 8 gingersnap cookies, ground in food processor 
 1/4 cup aged tamari soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon (1 turn around the pan in a slow drizzle) wok or vegetable oil 
 6 large (12-inch) flour tortillas 
 1 cup hoisin sauce 
 Shred up a pile of your favorite raw vegetables or 
 2 cups shredded cabbage 
 Shredded carrots 
 Fresh bean sprouts 
 Thinly sliced scallions 
 Cooked jasmine rice 
 Water 
 Salt 
 Duck sauce 
 Toasted sesame seeds 
 1 European seedless cucumber or 2 Kirby cucumbers, thinly sliced 
 1 small red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced 
 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar or white distilled vinegar 
 2 rounded teaspoons sugar 
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the pork, cabbage, cayenne pepper, garlic, gingersnap cookies, and soy sauce in a bowl. Form mixture into patties. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add wok or vegetable oil to the pan. Cook patties 7 minutes on each side. Heat tortillas on a nonstick surface over high heat for 30 seconds on each side. Paint the tortillas with hoisin sauce, leaving a 1-inch rim from edge. Pile shredded mixed veggies in center of tortilla and top with cooked pork patty. Fold the tortilla up on all four sides and wrap burger in a square package. Invert pork pocket and cut on diagonal. Serve pockets with jasmine rice sundaes and cucumber salad. Scoop prepared jasmine rice onto dinner plates using an ice cream scoop. Top with duck sauce and toasted sesame seed "sprinkles". This is a great use for those packets of leftover duck sauce that clutter up your junk drawers in the kitchen and kids love the look of the technique. Spread cucumber slices in a thin layer on double-ply paper towels. Roll paper towels up to squeeze water from sliced cucumbers. Transfer sliced cucumbers to a bowl and toss with sliced peppers. Combine remaining ingredients in a small plastic container and shake until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers, toss, and serve. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed 
 1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped 
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 3 chipotle peppers in adobo 
 1 cup ketchup 
 1/3 cup brown sugar

 1/2 tablespoon liquid smoke 
 1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard 
 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 
 Instructions: 
 Heat a medium heavy-bottomed pan over high heat. Add the butter, onions and garlic and saute until the onions are translucent and soft. Turn the heat down to medium, add the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and chipotle peppers and cook for 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, 3/4 cup water, brown sugar, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, liquid smoke, yellow mustard and Worcestershire sauce and cook for 15 minutes. With a hand mixer, blend the sauce until smooth. There will be some lumpiness from the onions and garlic, and if you like, strain these out through a sieve. Otherwise, simmer the sauce on low for another 15 minutes. Remove and cool. Store in a plastic container in the fridge for up to 1 month. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup dried porcinis 
 4 ounces chanterelles, halved 
 Extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt 
 Four 1/8-inch slices guanciale, finely diced 
 10 leaves fresh sage, plus 2 sprigs for the sauce 
 2 cups ricotta cheese 
 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano, plus more for garnish 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 
 10 large eggs, all heirloom or organic 
 All-purpose flour, as needed 
 1/2 recipe Chef Anne's All-Purpose Pasta Dough, rolled into sheets for ravioli, recipe follows 
 Semolina flour, as needed 
 1 stick unsalted butter 
 1/2 cup chicken stock 
 1 pound all-purpose flour 
 4 large eggs plus 1 yolk, all heirloom or organic 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 to 2 tablespoons water, or more if needed 
 Kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Cover the porcinis with hot or room temp water and allow to sit for 30 minutes. Remove from the liquid with a slotted spoon before dicing into small pieces. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the chanterelles with olive oil and season with salt. Put on a sheet tray and roast in the oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Reserve for garnish. To a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the guanciale and render until crispy. Transfer the guanciale with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel-lined plate. To the guanciale fat in the pan, add the sage leaves and fry until crispy, about 30 seconds. Season the sage leaves with salt. Crumble the sage and set aside. Reserve the guanciale and sage for garnish. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmigiano, parsley, 2 whole eggs and the diced porcinis; mix well and season with salt. Dust a clean work surface lightly with all-purpose flour and lay out 2 sheets (at least 12 inches long) of the rolled Chef Anne's All-Purpose Pasta Dough; brush them lightly with water. Equally space 4 dollops of the ricotta mixture on each pasta sheet, then use a spoon to make a "nest" or small hole in the center of each dollop. Carefully separate the remaining 8 eggs one at a time and put a yolk in each ricotta "nest" the ricotta should lovingly nestle each yolk (if a yolk breaks, scoop it out with a spoon and don't use it). Cover each sheet of ricotta "nests" and egg yolks with another sheet of pasta. Use your index fingers to press around each ricotta nest to seal the edges, then use a fluted ring cutter or dough roller to cut around each ravioli (they should be 3 to 4 inches in diameter). Reserve the ravioli on a tray generously dusted with semolina. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. In a large saute pan, melt 1/2 stick of the butter and add 1/4 cup of the chicken stock (you're going to use the remainder for your next batch); add a sage sprig and season with salt. Bring this to boil and reduce to a simmer. Add 4 of the ravioli to the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes, no more. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully transfer the ravioli from the water to the pan with the butter and chicken stock and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. If the sauce reduces too much, add a few drops of the pasta cooking water. The sauce should cling to the ravioli in a buttery hug. Repeat with the remaining 4 ravioli, using the remaining 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup chicken stock and 1 sprig sage to make the sauce. Transfer the ravioli to serving plates, 1 per plate. Spoon a little extra sauce over each one and finish with a sprinkey-dink of the grated Parm, guanciale, chanterelles and fried sage. Put the flour on a clean dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, water and salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don't worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately after that, do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into the desired shape. How smooth and supple! <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 
 1 1/3 cup plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
 3 large eggs 
 3/4 cup milk 
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 
 1/4 cup heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons orange zest (from 3 to 4 oranges) 
 1 teaspoon instant yeast 
 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 
 1 orange 
 3 cups fresh squeezed orange juice 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1/3 cup pine nuts 
 16 orange segments (from about 2 oranges) 
 Creme fraiche 
 Instructions: 
 For the cake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the 2 teaspoons flour and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Brush an 8-inch round cake pan with olive oil and then dust with the flour-sugar mix. With a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs on high speed with the 1 1/3 cup sugar until they turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the milk, the 1/2 cup olive oil, the cream and orange zest. Mix the 1 1/3 cup flour, the yeast and salt together and incorporate into the batter, scraping down the sides as needed. Combine well, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow the batter to rest in a warm place 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until toothpick inserted comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven allow to cool in the pan 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the edge of the pan, turn the pan over, tapping if necessary to release the cake, and place on a rack and allow to cool completely. Once cool, invert and place on a rimmed cake plate. For the syrup: Remove the zest from the orange using a peeler, avoiding the pith, and place in a medium saucepan with the orange juice and sugar. Cook over medium heat until a thick syrup forms, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Strain and discard the zest strips. Pour 1/2 the syrup over the cooled cake, and then pierce the surface with a fork to allow the syrup to soak into the cake. Return the remaining syrup to the stove and continue to reduce until very thick and syrupy, an additional 15 to 20 minutes. For the toppings: In a small skillet, lightly toast the pine nuts over medium heat until just starting to color, 3 to 4 minutes. Roughly chop the pine nuts. Arrange the segmented oranges around the outside edge of the cake and place a small fan of them in the center. Garnish with the pine nuts and drizzle with the reduced syrup. Cut into slices and serve with creme fraiche. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 8 ounces slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch strips or lardons (about 2 cups) 
 2 cups instant rice 
 1 cup frozen peas 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 Zest and juice of 1 lemon 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon lardons until browned and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with the recommended amount of water on the package. Add the peas and salt and cook according to the rice package instructions. Stir in the Parmesan, butter, lemon zest and juice and black pepper. Mix in the bacon and serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 5 or 6 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled 
 2 or 3 Portobello mushroom caps, sliced thin 
 1 cup grated hard cheese such as Parmesan or Asiago 
 3/4 cup half and half 
 Kosher salt and ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Heat oven to 400 degrees and butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and set aside. Using a mandolin, V-slicer or the slicing attachment on a food processor, slice the potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick. (If you don't want to slice all the potatoes at once, slice them one at a time and build the gratin as you go.) Create the first layer by laying the slices in overlapping rows. Once the first layer is down, season lightly with salt and pepper, then scatter with mushroom slices and a couple tablespoons of the cheese. (Don't over-do it on these layers, if you create a barrier between the adjoining potato layers, the gratin won't set.) Continue building layers until you're out of potatoes or out of room to build, but be sure to save 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top. Pour 2/3 cup of the half and half over the gratin then spread both hands over the surface and push down to work the air out from the layers. Add remaining liquid only if half and half does not come to the surface when you push down. Sprinkle the gratin with cheese, cover loosely with foil and place in middle of oven for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting the point of a paring knife straight into the gratin. If it goes through smoothly, remove the foil, return to oven, and turn on the broiler just long enough to turn the top golden-brown. Remove, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 8 strips bacon 
 1 stick unsalted butter 
 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 3 1/2 cups whole milk 
 6 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, plus more for sprinkling 
 1 large egg, beaten 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 8 slices thick white sandwich bread, toasted, crusts removed 
 1 pound leftover roast turkey, sliced 
 1 ripe tomato, sliced 
 Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the broiler. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, then drain on paper towels. Meanwhile, make the cheese sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to make a thick roux. Add the milk and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parmesan, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the egg until the sauce is thick (do not boil). Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. For each Hot Brown, place 2 bread slices side by side in a small baking dish. Cover the bread with about 1/4 pound turkey and place 1 or 2 tomato slices alongside. Pour 1/2 to 3/4 cup cheese sauce over the turkey and bread. Sprinkle with more parmesan and broil until the sauce is bubbly and speckled brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the broiler, cross 2 strips of bacon on top and sprinkle with parsley and more parmesan. Serve immediately. Photo by John Nation <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed 
 1 cup Chocolate Rum Ganache, recipe follows 
 4 canned pineapple rings or fresh pineapple cut into rings, and then into 6 pieces each 
 8 glaced cherries 
 1/3 cup apricot jam 
 2 tablespoons water 
 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 
 1 cup heavy cream 
 1 tablespoon dark rum 
 Instructions: 
 To make the tarts, dust a work-surface lightly with flour and roll the puff pastry a little thinner. Chill to let it rest about 20 minutes. With a very sharp knife, cut dough into 3-inch squares. Fold each square in half diagonally, forming an isosceles triangle. Lay triangle on a flat surface with the base closest to you. Starting at the base, cut a 1/4-inch wide band along each side of the triangle, stopping just before you reach the point. On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, unfold the triangle. There should be a band around the entire square that is attached only at 2 opposing corners. Paint the band with water. Grab the band at the 2 detached corners and cross them over each other, creating a rim around the tart shell and a decorative loop at the 2 corners that are still attached. Press the band into the dough. Prick the bottom then chill again, for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake for 20 minutes in the top 1/3 of the oven until golden brown. Cool on the pan. Knock down the centers of the tart shells if needed. Once the tart shells have cooled, put 1 tablespoonful of the chocolate ganache into each of them. Cover the middle with sections of pineapple rings and place half cherries at the corners. Warm the apricot jam and water together, and brush it on to glaze the tarts. Let the glaze set up, and then serve as soon as possible. Place the chopped chocolate in a bowl. In a saucepan, heat the cream until boiling. Pour it over the chocolate and whisk well. Whisk in the rum and strain it into a bowl. Cover and chill overnight. This next day carefully whip it until stiff. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 pounds smoked turkey neck bones, large dice 
 2 ribs celery, rough chopped 
 2 carrots, rough chopped 
 2 cloves garlic, smashed 
 1 medium onion, rough chopped 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth (or turkey stock if available) 
 2 sprigs fresh thyme 
 Instructions: 
 In a heavy-bottom saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and chopped turkey necks, browning the bones on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, garlic and onion and saute until the onions are translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium, then add the flour to create a roux. Stir well and cook until the roux is a deep brown color and has a nutty aroma, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken broth and thyme, while using a whisk to stir. Stir and cook until the gravy is smooth and there are no lumps. Bring to a boil then simmer to reduce slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove the gravy from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a smaller saucepan. Discard the solids. Taste and adjust seasoning. Keep warm until ready to serve. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/4 cup orange marmalade 
 1 orange, zested and juiced 
 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from canned chipotle in adobo (pop the chipotles in plastic baggie and freeze for later use) 
 1/3 cup white wine vinegar 
 1/3 cup canola oil 
 1 pound jicama root, peeled 
 2 cups shredded carrots 
 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves 
 Instructions: 
 Whisk the marmalade with orange juice, chipotle sauce, vinegar and oil. Cut the jicama into pieces to fit in the feeder of a food processor. Place shredder attachment blade in bowl and shred the jicama. Toss jicama and carrots with dressing and cilantro. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
 Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 cup whole milk 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1 tablespoon canola oil 
 3 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch rounds 
 1 sweet onion, chopped 
 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 6 cups chicken stock or low-fat, reduced-sodium chicken broth 
 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch cubes 
 2 sprigs fresh thyme 
 10 ounces fresh baby spinach 
 Instructions: 
 To prepare the dumplings, in a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, parsley and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a simmer over low heat; season with black pepper. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. In a second large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, onions and sweet potatoes. Cook until the onions are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds. Add the stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to simmer. Add the chicken and thyme. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, drop the dough, about 1 tablespoon at a time, into the simmering stock. Cover and simmer until the dumplings and chicken are cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. (The best way to see if the dumplings are cooked is to remove one from the pot and let it cool slightly. Using a chef's knife, halve the dumpling. If the center looks dry, it is cooked. If the dumpling looks gummy or wet, let them cook a bit longer.) Stir in the spinach; cover and continue cooking for an additional 30 to 45 seconds. Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper. Ladle into warmed bowls and serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 15 shrimp 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 
 Salt 
 Crushed red pepper flakes, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 For the pasta: To hand-make the pasta mix the flour, salt, and eggs together over a well floured surface and thin with a rolling pin. Roll the dough out and cut into 1/3-inch wide by 1-inch long strips. Unroll the strips and then place in a plate and sprinkle with flour. Allow to sit for 30 minutes before cooking. For the sauce: In a large saucepan heat 2 tablespoons oil, add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds. When the garlic is blonde add the calamari and 1 1/2 cups white wine and let it simmer for 10 minutes with the lid on. As the calamari gets softer, add the peeled tomatoes to the pan and keep covered over a medium heat. At the same time, in a separate large pan add the 1/2 cup olive oil, the remaining 1/2 cup white wine, mussels, clams, cover and cook until the shellfish open. Drain the liquid in the pan through a strainer; discard solids and set the liquid aside. Transfer the opened mussels and clams to the pan with the calamari, add a cup of the drained liquid, the shrimp, the parsley, crushed red pepper flakes, and salt to taste and cook for 10 more minutes. In a large pot bring water to a boil and cook pasta and then drain. Add the sauce with the mussels and clams and let it simmer for a few more minutes. Serve hot. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 Nonstick cooking spray 
 2 cups skin-on almonds 
 1/4 cup clover honey 
 2 tablespoons sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 
 Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
 Fine sea salt 
 4 to 6 ripe yet firm stone fruits, such as peaches, nectarines and plums, halved and pitted 
 Canola oil, for brushing 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1 cup farmer's cheese 
 Instructions: 
 For the spiced honey almonds: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Spread the almonds on the prepared baking sheet, then transfer to the oven and toast lightly, 8 minutes. Combine the honey, sugar, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sugar melts. Put the toasted almonds in a small bowl and toss with half of the honey mixture until evenly coated; reserve the remaining spiced syrup. Using a heat-proof spatula (the mixture will be hot), spread the coated almonds in an even layer on the baking sheet. Set aside until hardened, 15 minutes to 1 hour--the almonds will remain slightly sticky. Once hardened, coarsely chop or use whole. For the grilled stone fruit: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Brush the cut sides of the fruit with a bit of oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the fruit, cut-side down, to mark and caramelize slightly, about 2 minutes. Brush the tops with a bit more oil, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and then flip and grill on the reverse side just to soften slightly, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the grilled fruit to a platter, cut-side up. Dollop the farmer's cheese around the fruit, drizzle some of the reserved spiced syrup over everything, and scatter the almonds on top. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 One 750-milliliter bottle red wine, such as Cabernet 
 1 cup diced carrots 
 1 cup diced Spanish onions 
 1 cup chopped celery 
 8 sprigs fresh thyme 
 6 cloves garlic 
 2 bay leaves 
 6 chicken thighs 
 2 cups button mushrooms, cleaned and cut in half 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons canola oil 
 8 ounces thick bacon, cut into 1/2-inch lardons 
 2 cups frozen pearl onions, thawed (they can be left to thaw overnight during prep) 
 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 
 Buttered egg noodles, for serving 
 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped 
 Instructions: 
 In a large resealable container, combine the red wine, carrots, onions, celery, thyme, garlic and bay leaves. Add the chicken thighs, seal the container and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the mushrooms with the olive oil on a baking sheet and roast until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside. Drain the chicken and vegetables thoroughly in a colander, reserving the wine mixture. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel (reserve the vegetables and aromatics). Season the chicken with salt and pepper and transfer to a clean bowl. Add the flour and toss until thoroughly coated. In a large Dutch oven, heat the canola oil over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring often, until caramelized and the bacon has released its fat, 5 to 8 minutes. Set the lardons aside. Turn the heat up to medium high and shake the excess flour off the chicken. Brown the chicken on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the pearl onions and drained vegetables and aromatics to the same pot and cook over medium heat until caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the reserved red wine mixture and cook until reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Return the chicken to the pot and cover. Transfer to the oven and cook until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes. If necessary, finish the dish on the stove by simmering it uncovered to reduce the mixture further, depending on how thick you'd like the sauce. Serve with buttered egg noodles on the side and chopped parsley. Garnish with the reserved lardons and mushrooms. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 pound ground beef 
 3/4 pound ground pork 
 1 teaspoon hot paprika 
 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 3 small yellow onions, peeled and minced (should equal roughly 1 cup) 
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 
 1 cup bread crumbs 
 2/3 cup ketchup 
 1 cup sour cream 
 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, stemmed, washed, dried and chopped, 1/4 cup total 
 1 small bunch tarragon, stemmed, washed, dried and chopped, 1/4 cup total 
 3 eggs, lightly beaten 
 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 
 Additional ketchup for brushing, if desired 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix the beef and pork and gently knead them together with your hands. Add the paprika, salt and pepper.

 16 ounces strawberries 
 6 ounces raspberries 
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon cornstarch 
 4 sticks (2 cups) unsalted butter 
 8 ounces vegetable shortening 
 2 1/2 pounds confectioners' sugar 
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: two 8-inch round pans For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, salt and 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, coconut extract and 7 egg yolks in a large bowl until well combined.

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds beef tenderloin, round or other cut for quick cooking 
 4 ounces good quality smokehouse-style slab bacon 
 1/2 cup finely chopped white onion 
 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 
 3 tablespoons chili paste from ancho chili powder 
 2 tablespoons toasted and ground cumin seed 
 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 
 2 tablespoons brown sugar

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup water 
 1/2 cup whole milk 
 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1/4 ounce package) 
 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl 
 1 large egg yolk 
 1 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (13 ounces) 
 1/4 cup sugar (1 3/4 ounces) 
 3/4 teaspoon fine salt (1/8 ounce) 
 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 
 1/3 cup granulated sugar 
 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 
 3/4 cups (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, very soft, plus more for coating the pan 
 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar 
 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk 
 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter 
 3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the water and milk in a medium saucepan and warm over low heat until it is about 100 degrees F (but no more than 110 degrees). Remove from heat and sprinkle the yeast over the surface over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top and set aside without stirring, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture. Whisk the flour, the sugar, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put dough in the buttered bowl, turning to coat lightly with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release excess air; reform into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with plastic and proof in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. To fill and form the rolls: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Whisk the sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Turn prepared dough onto a floured work surface and press, then roll into 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with a long edge facing you. Spread the softened butter evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving about an inch border on the side opposite you. Evenly scatter the cinnamon-sugar over the butter. Starting from the long side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight cylinder. Lightly brush the clean edge of the dough with water. Press the open long edge to the dough to seal the cylinder. Slip a long taut piece of string or dental floss under the roll, about 1 1/2 inches from the end. Lift and cross the string ends over the roll, then pull the ends tightly in opposite directions to cut a single roll. Repeat, cutting every 1 1/2 inches, to make 12 rolls. Place the rolls cut-side-down in the prepared pan, leaving 1 inch of space between them. Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place to rise until rolls double in size, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake buns until golden brown and the tops of the buns spring back when pressed lightly, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. To make the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl. Whisk in the condensed milk, butter, and lemon juice to make a smooth, slightly loose icing. Add the vanilla and cinnamon. Drizzle the icing over warm buns. Serve. <|endoftext|>

In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks. Add the powdered sugar, a little at a time, and continue to beat until stiff but still shiny. Whisk 1/4 of the meringue into the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold the remaining meringue into the mixture. Combine the flour, cocoa, almond meal and salt. Sift and gently fold into the egg mixture, a little at a time. Divide evenly into the 4 buttered baking sheets and with an offset spatula, spread evenly. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or spongy and cooked. Reserve and allow to cool completely. To prepare the Coffee Syrup: in a saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil for 2 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in instant espresso. Reserve until needed. To prepare the Chocolate Mousse: in a saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil. Lower to a simmer and reserve. In a mixing bowl, using a whisk, whip the egg yolks on high speed until light and ribbony. Lower the speed and whisk in the hot syrup. Continue to beat until slightly cool. Fold in the melted chocolate and lastly, fold in the whipped cream. Reserve until needed. To assemble the 16 layer cake: Cut each cake into 2 pieces horizontally. Place the first layer on a piece of cardboard. Brush with some of the coffee simple syrup. Spread 1/8 of the chocolate mousse evenly over the cake. Top with another layer of genoise and repeat the process until you have 8 layers of genoise brushed with coffee simple syrup and chocolate mousse. Chill for 2 hours. Trim off about 1/4-inch from all the sides with a serrated knife that has been dipped in hot water. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake, and using an offset spatula, spread the ganache to evenly cover the top and sides of the cake. Refrigerate for 20 minutes, or until the chocolate hardens. Dust the top with cocoa powder. 2 cups heavy cream 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Bring the cream to a simmer in a heavy saucepan. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour the cream over the chocolate and whisk until the mixture is smooth. Cool slightly. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 cups cool water 
 Small potato, for testing salinity 
 Salt 
 6 (4-ounce) fresh salmon fillets 
 1/4 cup liquid honey 
 1/4 cup Islay Whisky 
 Salad of Fresh Mixed Greens, recipe follows 
 2 tablespoons virgin olive oil 
 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice 
 1 tablespoon oak-aged balsamic vinegar 
 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 
 Pinch freshly ground pepper 
 Small handful fresh tarragon, finely chopped 
 About 3 handfuls mixed greens 
 Instructions: 
 To make brine, pour 4 cups of water into a non-reactive bowl. Add a small potato about the size of a golf ball to the water. It will sink to the bottom. Now begin pouring salt into the water, mixing gently, until the potato bobs to the surface of the water. Discard potato. Place salmon fillets in brine and allow to soak in a cool place for 1 hour. Remove salmon fillets from brine solution and pat dry. Set aside. In a measuring cup, blend together honey and whisky. Gently brush fillets with blended honey and whisky mixture. Smoke fillets for 9 hours in smoke house or water smoker. Alternatively, soak wood shavings or chips (apple, beech, or untreated cedar) in water for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare a small charcoal fire in a dome-shaped barbecue. You are trying to maintain a covered temperature somewhere between 200 and 300 degrees F. When the coals are glowing, place salmon fillets on the grill on the side opposite to the coals. Sprinkle damp wood chips over coals and cover grill. Because this method is somewhat hotter than smokehouse or smoker methods, smoke fish for about 45 minutes. Check progress halfway through cooking. You are looking for a bronzed, shiny exterior and a firm buttery interior. Serve fillets with a side of mixed greens and dressing. Top fillets with a small drizzle of Islay whisky. Make dressing. In a small bowl whisk together the first 6 ingredients in the order in which they appear. Toss mixed greens with dressing until evenly coated. Arrange greens to one side of plate. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup shiitake mushrooms 
 1 cup crimini mushrooms 
 1 cup button mushrooms 
 1 cup morel mushrooms 
 1 cup portobello mushrooms 
 2 bay leaves 
 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 4 cups water 
 3 tablespoons clarified butter 
 2 shallots, diced 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 2 tablespoons yellow curry powder 
 2 tablespoons fresh basil, thyme, rosemary and parsley, chopped 
 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced 
 1/4 cup Spanish olive oil 
 1/4 cup white truffle oil (or Hazelnut oil) 
 3/4 cup rice vinegar 
 1 pinch salt and pepper 
 Instructions: 
 The stems and caps of the mushrooms are used for different parts of the recipe, so separating them is the first step. Take a knife and cut the stems from the caps of all the different mushroom varieties, put the caps in one bowl, and the stems in another. Next we make a stock by placing all the mushroom stems into a pot, along with the bay leaves, white peppercorns, teaspoon of salt and water. Bring that to a heavy boil, and let reduce. All of this needs to reduce to 1/4 of a cup of finished stock, so patience is needed. After about 15 to 20 minutes on high heat, take the stock and pour through a fine strainer, if 1/4 cup of liquid is left, discard the pulp and save the liquid off to one side. Take the mushroom caps, and slice them. Add the sliced mushroom caps and saute in butter until tender. Then add in the shallots and garlic, and only saute for about another minute, or until the shallots and garlic are translucent. Pull the saute pan off the stove, and add the curry powder, fresh herbs, red bell peppers, oils, rice vinegar, pinch of salt and pepper, and mushroom stock. Pour this mixture into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour, to allow all the flavors and aromas of the stock to infuse into the mushrooms. Strain this salad, and serve the mushrooms on one plate, and save the stock as a dressing. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 tablespoons peanut oil 
 2 large onions, minced 
 3-inch piece smoked fish (guedge or yete if possible) 
 1 6-ounce can tomato paste 
 9 cups slightly salted cold water 
 1 bunch parsley, trimmed 
 2 large cloves garlic 
 1 fresh bird chile 
 2 scallions 
 3 pounds sea bass tail, cleaned and cut into steaks 1 1/2 inches thick 
 1/2 pound calabaza, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice 
 1/2 pound sweet cassava, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice 
 5 small purple turnips, quartered 
 1 small green cabbage, cut into eighths 
 4 sweet potatoes, quartered 
 2 small eggplants, cut into 1-inch slices 
 5 carrots, scraped and cut into chunks 
 12 small okra pods, washed and topped and tailed (any hard pods discarded) 
 1 habanero chile, pricked with a fork 
 2 pounds broken rice 
 Instructions: 
 Heat the oil in a large stockpot and brown the onion. Add the smoked fish, the tomato paste, and 1/4 cup of the salted water. While the onion mixture is browning, prepare the stuffing for the sea bass steaks by placing the parsley, garlic, chile, and scallions in a food processor and pulsing until they form a thick paste. When the paste is ready, score the sea bass steaks and poke the stuffing into the slits. Place the sea bass in the stockpot with the onion mixture, allow it to cook for 5 minutes, and add the remaining water. When the fish mixture comes to a boil, cover the pot, lower the heat, and add the vegetables in the order given, finishing off with the pricked habanero chile, which you will remove (and reserve) when the thiebou dienn is spicy enough for you. Cook for 20 minutes. Remove the sea bass steaks keeping them whole, and place them on a serving platter. Cover them with a bit of the cooking liquid, and keep them warm. Continue cooking the thiebou dienn for an additionaly 15 minutes, then remove the vegetables and arrange them on a platter and keep them warm. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid to make the sauces. Return the remaining liquid to a boil, add the rice, cover, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is done. While the rice is cooking, pulverize the habanero chile that you have reserved and add it to 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid. Heat it, stirring occasionally, and place it in a sauceboat. Heat the remaining cup of reserved cooking liquid and place it in a separate sauceboat. This will give you a regular sauce and a fiery hot one. When ready to serve, mound the rice on one platter and the fish and vegetables on another. Alternatively, you can place the rice in a large basin or deep dish and arrange the vegetables and fish on top and eat Senegalese-style with your hands (right hand only, please!) or with a large spoon. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3/4 cup blanched almonds 
 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 
 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 
 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 
 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 1 tablespoon freeze-dried coffee, dissolved in 1 teaspoon boiling water 
 1 cup chocolate Ganache, at room temperature 
 2 1/4 ounces bittersweet chocolate 
 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon heavy cream 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the almonds and brown sugar. Process until completely ground. Using an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed until frothy. Add 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue whipping until very stiff peaks and the whites just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the mixture and fold in the almond and sugar mixture. When almost completely incorporated, add the 2 teaspoons of coffee and continue folding until mixed. The batter must be smooth an shiny, and it should spread easily without being runny. If it is dull and firm, fold it a little longer to deflate it slightly and get the required consistency. But do not deflate it too much or the batter with spread too much and the tops of the cookies will crack when baked. Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with a 3/4 inch plain pastry tube, with the batter. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper. Pipe the domes in staggering rows 1 inch wide and 1 inch apart. Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time. Bake for 1 minute. Place an empty baking sheet underneath the sheet of cookies, and continue baking, using a wooden spatula to hold the oven door ajar, until the tops of the cookies are very lightly browned and dry to the touch white the insides are still soft and the bottoms still pale, about 8 to 10 minutes. Lift the baking sheet of cookies off the empty baking sheet and take it to the sink. Pour cold water, about 1/2 cup, between the paper and the baking sheet (tilting the baking sheet so that the water runs over the entire surface and drains thoroughly into the sink) to steam the cookies off the paper. Then place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool. Spread the bottoms of half the cookies with some of the Ganache. Place the remaining cookies, right side up, on top of the Ganache, pressing slightly to form a sandwich. Place the filled macaroons on a serving plate. Chop the chocolate and put it in a small stainless steel bowl. Bring the cream just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Gradually stir the cream into the chocolate with the whisk and continue stirring until the chocolate is completely melted. Then, allow it to cool, stirring occasionally with a wooden spatula, until it starts to thicken. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons Champagne vinegar 
 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh garlic 
 1 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature* 
 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 cup good olive oil 
 Salad greens or mesclun mix for 6 to 8 people 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, garlic, egg yolk, salt, and pepper. While whisking, slowly add the olive oil until the vinaigrette is emulsified. Toss the greens with enough dressing to moisten and serve. Note: If you're worried about raw egg, eliminate it from the recipe. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 cups whole blanched almonds 
 1/4 cup honey 
 2 teaspoons cinnamon 
 1 orange, zest grated

 Ingredients: 
 4 large egg whites 
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 1 cup sugar (preferably superfine) 
 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa 
 2 ounces bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate, cut into small pieces 
 Cookie sheet lined with parchment paper 
 Pastry bag fitted with plain 1/2-inch tip (Ateco #8) 
 Instructions: 
 Combine egg whites with cream of tartar in bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in sugar, beating at high speed until mixture is very stiff and dull looking. Scrape meringue mixture into pastry bag. Pipe round, button shapes to make mushroom "caps". Pipe pointed "kiss" shapes about one inch tall to make "stems". Dust with cocoa. Bake two hours in 200 degree oven until crisp and completely dry. Assemble the mushrooms: Place chocolate in a small bowl. Set bowl in a skillet of barely simmering water. Immediately turn off heat and stir chocolate until melted and smooth. Spread a little melted chocolate on the flat side of each meringue mushroom "cap". Use a sharp knife to cut off and discard the pointed ends of meringue "stems". Attach stems to caps while chocolate is still soft. Set assembled mushrooms aside until the chocolate has dried and caps and stems are "glued" together. Meringue mushrooms may be made 3-4 weeks in advance and stored in an airtight container. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup leftover poaching oil from Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows 
 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice 
 8 to 10 drops hot sauce 
 2 tablespoons chopped scallions 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 
 2 lemon slices from Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows, finely minced 
 16 ounces leftover Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows, flaked 
 3 cups olive oil 
 1 1/2 to 2 pounds flounder fillets 
 Kosher salt 
 Freshly ground black pepper

 Ingredients: 
 12 ounces Angus chuck ground beef 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
 12 strips bacon 
 3 sesame seed burger buns 
 3 organic free-range eggs 
 4 1/4 ounces Quebec cheese curds 
 3 leaves lettuce, for serving 
 6 slices heirloom tomato, for serving 
 9 slices dill pickle, for serving 
 15 slices jalapeno, for serving 
 6 slices red onion, for serving 
 3 teaspoons Portuguese pepper aioli or your favorite aioli, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the grill to high heat. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper and form into 3 patties. Grill to desired doneness. Meanwhile, alongside the beef on the grill, cook the bacon to desired crispness and toast the buns. Fry the eggs sunny-side up on the grill, and then transfer to a plate. When the burgers are almost done cooking, top with the cheese curds. Top each burger patty with 1 egg, 4 strips of the bacon, 1 lettuce leaf, 2 tomato slices, 3 pickle slices, 5 jalapeno slices, 2 onion slices and 1 teaspoon of the aioli and serve on the toasted buns. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 large white onion, minced 
 1/2 cup minced lemon grass, packed 
 2 large stalks celery, well scrubbed and minced 
 1 large leek, soaked several times in salt water to remove grit, minced 
 1-ounce fresh ginger root, covering scraped off with the tip of a spoon and minced 
 3/4 pound lean fish scraps and shrimp shells 
 3 egg whites 
 2 quarts fish stock, chilled 
 1 lemon, juiced 
 1 pound edamame (immature soybeans in their pods) 
 1 pound (31-40) shrimp, deveined, shells and tails removed, and all other black veins removed 
 8 egg whites 
 3 scallions, white and tender green parts only, sliced 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 Instructions: 
 To make the "white" mirepoix, mix the onion, lemon grass, celery, and leek and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. (In combination with the fish and egg whites, the mirepoix will form the clarification to make the consomme crystal clear. This combination of ingredients will form what is referred to as a raft that essentially coagulates as the consomme clarifies.) Mix the chilled mirepoix, ginger root, fish scraps, shrimp shells, and egg white and add to a stockpot. Pour in the chilled fish stock. Add the lemon juice. Bring to a simmer (just below a boil in classical cooking) over low heat, stirring frequently so that the clarification ingredients remain free floating. Please note that the heat must be kept at a simmer, low enough so that the raft which is forming does not break apart from the action of cooking and high enough to cook out the impurities so that they can be collected in the raft. Once the raft forms and rises to the surface, cease stirring. However, gather some broth from the edge of the pot and baste the raft to keep it from breaking apart. After 60 to 90 minutes at the correct simmer, the raft will begin to sink, at which point the consomme is finished. For the edamame, add soybeans in their pods to a pot and cover with water. Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and set aside until needed. In a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, scallions, salt and pepper to a paste. Spoon some of this mixture into a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe tiny dumplings into the consomme and poach. Spoon 1/4 cup edamame into bowls, and ladle soup over. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 1/2 pound boneless top loin pork roast 
 2/3 cup panko, (Japanese bread crumbs) 
 1/3 cup fontina cheese, shredded (about 1 ounce) 
 1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped 
 salt and pepper 
 4 thin slices prosciutto 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine panko, fontina, and sage. Stand roast on end and insert thin-bladed knife down center of loin to make 2-inch opening all the way through. Use your fingers to force the slit into a long 1-inch-diameter hole. Pack panko mixture into hole, working from both ends of roast. Season roast on all sides with salt and pepper. Place roast, fat side up, on work surface. Arrange prosciutto slices across top of roast. Tie with kitchen twine at 1- to 1 1/2-inch intervals. Place in shallow roasting pan, prosciutto side up, and roast 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Remove roast from oven and let rest 10 minutes. Remove twine. Slice roast and arrange on serving platter. Serve drizzled with any pan juices. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted, plus more for rolling 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 1 large egg 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 3 tablespoons meringue powder 
 2 tablespoons water 
 1/2 cup sanding sugar 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl, sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg; beat until combined. Gradually add sifted ingredients, and mix on low speed until combined. Add vanilla. Shape dough into a disk, wrap in plastic, and chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Heat oven to 325 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-inch thick. Using a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out about 4 dozen circles. Using a clean rubber stamp, imprint an initial into the center of each cookie. Transfer to ungreased baking sheets, and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake until edges start to brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons meringue powder with 2 tablespoons water until smooth. Decorate 1 cookie at a time; using a small paintbrush, lightly brush each imprinted initial with meringue. Sprinkle sanding sugar in the initial, and tap out excess over a small bowl. Using a toothpick or small dry paintbrush, gently remove the excess sugar in and around the letter. Brush the edge of each cookie with meringue. Roll the edge of each cookie in sanding sugar to coat. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to dry completely, 1 to 2 hours. Cookies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container up to 4 days. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 cup sugar 
 2 tablespoons cornstarch 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 2 cups whole milk 
 6 fresh mint sprigs 
 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70% cacao), chopped 
 Instructions: 
 In a large heavy saucepan, stir the sugar and cornstarch to blend. Whisk in the cream and milk and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Transfer the cream mixture to a heatproof bowl and add the mint. Set the bowl over a bowl of ice water to cool the mixture down quickly and stir occasionally until cool; discard the mint after 5 minutes. (Don't steep the mint for too long or it will impart a grassy flavor; a quick steep while the cream cools will do.) Cover the mint cream and refrigerate about 4 hours, or until completely cold. Freeze the mint cream in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions until frozen. Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, set it over a saucepan of simmering water and stir the chocolate until it has just melted. Remove from the heat and cool until the chocolate is barely warm and still fluid. Transfer the gelato to a large bowl set over a bowl of ice. Working quickly, drizzle the melted chocolate into the gelato while whisking or stirring vigorously. The chocolate will flake apart as it hits the cold gelato, forming bits of chocolate throughout. If you prefer larger pieces of chocolate throughout the gelato, use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the melted chocolate. Serve immediately, or transfer to a container and freeze until firm, 3 to 4 hours. Curtis serves his homemade gelato between waffle cookies. Photograph by Ray Kachatorian <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 small onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 One 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes 
 1 cup low-sodium beef broth 
 1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, sliced 
 2 teaspoons soy sauce 
 1 dried bay leaf 
 1 1/4 pounds flank steak, cut along the grain into 3-by-1 1/2-inch strips 
 1/3 cup pimento-stuffed olives, halved 
 3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves 
 Cooked rice, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Toss the onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a microwave-safe 4-quart bowl. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap; cut a small slit in the center with the tip of a paring knife to vent excess steam. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until the onions are soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. (See Cook's Note re cooking times.) If the onions aren't cooked through, cover and microwave again in 30-second increments. (When removing the plastic wrap, be careful to avoid the hot steam.) Add the tomatoes, beef broth, red peppers, soy sauce, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some black pepper. Stir, then nestle in the steak. Tightly cover the bowl with 2 pieces of plastic wrap; cut a small slit in the center. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the plastic wrap (the bowl will be very hot), stir and cover again. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) for another 20 minutes. Uncover the bowl, and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove the steak with a slotted spoon onto a cutting board. (It will not be fall-apart tender at this stage but should be shreddable.) Using two forks, shred the steak; return it to the bowl, and stir in the olives. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap, cut a small slit in the center and microwave at 100 percent power for 5 minutes. Let the ropa vieja sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the cilantro, and serve with rice. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup dried currants 
 2 tablespoons brandy 
 3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 
 1/4 cup honey plus additional for glazing the buns if desired 
 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter 
 1/2 cup chopped pecans 
 Cream biscuit dough, 
 2 teaspoons cinnamon 
 Instructions: 
 In a small bowl let the currants macerate in the brandy and 1/4 cup hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are softened, and drain them. In a saucepan heat 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, and butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the sugar is melted. Pour the mixture into an 8 1/2-inch round cake pan, and sprinkle the pecans over it. Roll the dough into an 18- by 10-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface, force the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar through a coarse sieve evenly over the dough, and sprinkle the cinnamon and currants over the brown sugar. Beginning with a long side roll up the dough tightly, jelly-roll fashion. Cut it into 1-inch slices with a sharp knife, and fit the slices cut side up in one layer in the pan, pressing them down gently. Bake the buns in a pre-heated 425 degree F oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the dough comes out clean. Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan, invert the buns onto a plate, and invert them onto a platter so that the plain side is up. Brush the top with the additional honey, heated, if desired. (Or, if you prefer not to use the honey glaze, invert the buns directly onto a platter, sticky side up.); <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 onion, quartered 
 6 garlic cloves 
 1 (1-inch) cube peeled fresh gingerroot 
 1 jalapeno pepper or to taste, seeded 
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
 1/4 cup brown sugar 
 2 tablespoons peanut or cottonseed oil 
 1 (8 to 9) pound leg of lamb including the pelvic and shank bones, boned and butterflied 
 Instructions: 
 Make the marinade: In a food processor puree the onion, garlic, gingerroot and pepper, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, add the soy sauce, brown sugar, and the oil, and blend the mixture until it is just combined. Coat the lamb on both sides with the marinade and enclose it in a plastic bag. Let the lamb marinate, chilled, turning it several times if possible, overnight. Alternatively, let the lamb marinate at room temperature, turning it several times, for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat grill. Grill the lamb boned side up on a very clean rack 2 to 3 inches above glowing coals, basting it several times with the marinade, for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until it is seared and charred lightly. Transfer the lamb in a shallow roasting pan to a warm oven (170 degrees F to 190 degrees F) for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. (The lamb will continue to cook as it rests in the warm oven; at serving time a meat thermometer should register about 130 degrees F for medium-rare meat.) Cut the lamb into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange the slices on a heated platter, nap them with some of the remaining pan juices. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 ounces thick-sliced bacon, cut crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces 
 Freshly ground black pepper 
 1/4 cup dry white wine 
 1 small shallot, finely minced 
 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream 
 1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard 
 Salt 
 3 cups finely sliced green cabbage 
 3 cups finely sliced red cabbage 
 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 
 1/2 cup crumbled Roquefort 
 Instructions: 
 In a large heavy skillet over moderate heat add the bacon pieces, generously season with ground pepper and cook until crisp. Transfer the cooked bacon to paper towels to drain and remove the skillet from the heat. In a small saucepan combine the wine and shallots and simmer until reduced to a thick syrup. Whisk in the cream, mustard, salt and pepper and continue to simmer until thickened slightly.

 Ingredients: 
 Sushi rice 
 Nori 
 Avocado 
 Carrot 
 Eggplant (grilled Japanese) 
 Tofu (made crisp by frying) 
 Tomato 
 Cucumber (Chinese-without seeds, or regular is also ok) 
 Asparagus 
 Aburage (inari tofu skins) 
 Wilted spinach 
 Bell peppers, julienned 
 Scallions, julienned 
 Snow peas, julienned 
 Black sesame seeds 
 White sesame seeds 
 Black sesame seeds/salt combination 
 3 1/3 cups short grain rice 
 4 cups water, plus 1/4 cup water 
 6 tablespoons rice vinegar 
 5 tablespoons sugar 
 3 teaspoons salt 
 Instructions: 
 Place a half sheet of nori horizontally in front of you on your mat. Place rice on left third of nori, leaving border of nori all around. Place filling vertically across middle of rice. Fold near corner of nori over to begin folding into cone shape. Continue to roll until cone is formed. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce as condiments. Rinse rice in water until the water runs clear and then drain in a colander for 1 hour. Place the drained rice in a rice cooker or in a pot with a tight-fitting lid and add 4 cups water. Over medium heat, cover and bring the water to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes, reduce heat and allow to simmer for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes, or until water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, remove lid, and place a towel over pot. Replace lid and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. While the rice cooks, combine vinegar, sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat over low temperatures, stirring, until sugar and salt dissolve. Let cool. Empty rice into a hangiri (or other nonmetallic) tub and spread it evenly over the bottom with a shamoji (or large wooden spoon). Run the spatula through the rice in slicing motions to separate the grains. While doing this, slowly add vinegar mixture. Add only as much as is necessary; the rice should not be mushy. If you have help, fan the rice with an uchiwa (fan) during the cooling and mixing procedures. Do not refrigerate the rice. Keep it in the tub covered with a clean cloth until ready to use. The rice will last one day. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 5 shiitake mushrooms, diced 
 4 ounces green peas 
 4 ounces diced carrot 
 4 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled 
 2 small fresh lotus leaves (see Cook's Note) 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
 12 lotus seeds, cooked and popped (rubbery shell removed) 
 1 lotus flower for garnish, optional 
 Water for steaming 
 Soy sauce and sliced red chile 
 Instructions: 
 Bring a fry pan or wok to high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and stir-fry the vegetables for 2 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside. In the same pan, add the remaining oil then stir-fry the rice for 3 minutes, remove and set aside. In a large bowl, lay one lotus leaf inside the bowl, followed by the second lotus leaf, putting the rough side of the leaf face-down first. Arrange the stir-fried vegetables on top of the lotus leaf in a pattern, if desired and then, spreading them out evenly towards the middle of the leaf. Scoop the fried rice into the bowl on top of the arranged vegetables. Fold the edge of the first or inner lotus leaf first, pressing to enclose the rice, then fold the edges of the second or outer leaf, pressing down firmly until flat. Bring a steamer full of water to the bowl, and steam the lotus rice in its bowl on high heat for 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the steamer and turn the lotus rice upside down onto a serving plate. With a sharp knife, carefully make 2 long cuts on the first layer of lotus leaf from corner to corner, criss-crossing each other, and then fold the 4 sections back. Repeat this process with the other bottom lotus leaf. You should be left with 8 triangular sections to the leaf folded back, exposing the rice. Garnish with lotus flower and serve with soy sauce and chile dipping sauce. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar 
 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 
 3 large eggs 
 3/4 cup vegetable oil 
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
 2 cups grated zucchini (about 2 medium zucchini) 
 Turbinado sugar or other crystallized brown sugar, optional 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. Stir the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. When cominbed, mix in the oats. Make a well in the center of the ingredients. Whisk the eggs, oil, and vanilla together in a small bowl and pour the mixture into the well. Combine lightly, then stir in the zucchini. Do not overmix. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, mounding it up in the center. Sprinkle with the turbinado sugar if you wish. Bake for 60 or 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack covered with a clean dish towel to prevent indentations. Let the bread cool at least 10 minutes longer before slicing. The bread can be served warm or at room temperature. It keeps well and makes good toast, too. Variation: Brown-Sugar Carrot Bread Replace the zucchini with 2 cups grated carrot. Because the carrots are a little starchier, reduce the oats to 3/4 cup. <|endoftext|>

 Fresh ground white pepper 
 1 teaspoon sweet butter 
 1 pound large red heirloom tomato, sliced into 4 thick slices 
 Kosher salt 
 Fresh ground white pepper 
 1 fresh bay leaf, torn into 4 pieces 
 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced 
 2 sprigs fresh thyme, picked from the stem 
 1 to 2 ounces extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 ounces canola oil 
 4 ounces baby arugula

 2 ounces balsamic vinegar from Modena, Italy 
 1 teaspoon sweet butter 
 3 large or 4 small ears corn, fresh, preferably picked that day 
 1 tablespoon chopped chives 
 1 teaspoon sweet butter 
 Kosher salt 
 Fresh ground white pepper 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season the fish on all sides with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a saute pan over high heat. Sear the fish on the flesh side until it is golden brown. Turn the fillets over carefully and place the pan in the oven. Cook the fish in the oven to desired doneness. When the fish is done place 1/4 of the Shiitake Quinoa in the center of the plate. On top of the quinoa place a slice of Oven Roasted Tomato. Place the fish on top of the tomato. Place 1/4 of the Sauteed Arugala on top of the fish. Spoon the Bacon Balsamic Vinaigrette and Summer Corn Milk around the plate. Heat the oil in a saute pan. Add the shiitake mushrooms and cook until they start to release their liquid and soften. Add the quinoa and stir to coat the grains. Add the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook on a low flame until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is cooked, about 12 minutes. Take off the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir in the butter. Set in a warm place covered until needed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the 4 slices of tomato in a baking dish large enough to fit the tomatoes in 1 layer. Season with salt and pepper and place 1 piece of bay leaf on each tomato slice. Sprinkle a little of the garlic and thyme on top of the tomato slices. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Place the dish on the middle rack in the oven and roast until the tomato is just hot and soft, about 2 to 3 minutes (convection oven), do not overcook. Take out of oven, remove pieces of bay leaf and set in a warm place until needed. Heat the oil in a saute pan. Add the arugula and stir around until leaves are wilted. Season with salt and pepper, remove from the heat and set aside. Chop the bacon and put in a pan over a medium-low flame. Render the fat making sure not to let it burn. When the fat is rendered out of the bacon add the balsamic vinegar. Add the butter and blend in with an immersion blender or hand held electric beater. Cut the corn off the cob by running a knife down the length of the cob. Put the corn kernels in a juicer or into cheesecloth and squeeze to extract the corn milk. Put the corn milk into a small saucepan. Heat gently over a low flame and stir frequently (be careful not to heat it too quickly). When the corn milk is hot add the chives and butter and mix with an immersion blender. Season with salt and pepper and reserve in a warm place. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 small whole chickens, about 21/2 lbs each, giblets reserved 
 1 lemon, quartered 
 Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 1/3 cup chopped cilantro 
 1/3 cup minced parsley 
 2 Tbsp minced garlic 
 1 Tbsp powdered ginger 
 1/4 tsp saffron threads 
 1 preserved lemon, cut into small pieces 
 cup olive oil 
 2 large onions, thinly sliced 
 1 Tbsp paprika 
 2 Tbsp butter 
 1 cup black or violet olives 
 Preserved lemon peel, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Remove excess fat from chicken, rinse well inside and out and pat dry. Rub chickens with lemon inside and out and under skin of breasts. Rub with sea salt and set aside to marinate in a nonreactive baking dish, covered and refrigerated, overnight. Next day, rinse chickens again and pat dry. In a flameproof casserole large enough to hold both chickens combine cilantro, parsley, garlic, ginger, saffron, preserved lemon and pepper to taste. Add 1/4 cup water and chickens, turning to coat thoroughly, and rubbing some of the mixture inside. Add reserved giblets, except livers. Pour oil over and bring to a simmer over low heat. When chicken begins to sizzle, add onions, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Add livers and paprika and continue to cook, covered, 1 hour more. Remove chickens to a carving board and let rest, covered loosely with foil, while you finish the sauce. Cut giblets into small pieces and return to sauce. Using a fork, crush livers into sauce to thicken. Sauce should be thick -- if it is thin, boil until reduced and thickened. Add butter and olives. Heat, swirling pan, until sauce is emulsified. To serve, cut chickens into quarters and arrange on a warmed platter. Spoon sauce over and garnish with lemon peel. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3-inch pieces 
 Kosher salt 
 1 onion, quartered 
 4 sprigs fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried thyme 
 2 teaspoons dried oregano (preferably Mexican) 
 2 bay leaves 
 12 black peppercorns 
 24 dried corn husks 
 2 teaspoons ground cumin 
 1/3 cup plus 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 
 1 clove garlic, minced 
 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons sugar 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 4 cups masa harina (instant corn flour) 
 1 1/3 cups lard 
 Instructions: 
 Make the filling: Put the pork in a deep saucepan and cover with cold water (about 6 cups). Add 2 teaspoons salt, the onion, thyme, oregano, bay leaves and peppercorns; cover and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the pork is tender, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer the pork to a plate and shred. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid; keep warm. Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, 1 hour. Combine the pork, cumin, 1/3 cup chili powder, the garlic, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dough: Mix the masa harina, lard, 2 teaspoons salt, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 2 2/3 cups of the reserved cooking liquid in a bowl until combined. Drain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread about 3 tablespoons of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling. Set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, cover and steam until the dough is firm, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the steamer and let cool slightly before unwrapping.

 Ingredients: 
 2 teaspoons grated orange zest (2 oranges) 
 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 
 3 3/4 cups sugar 
 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 
 2 pounds fresh ripe purple figs, stems removed and halved lengthwise 
 Instructions: 
 Place the orange zest and orange juice in a medium (10-inch) heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset. Add the sugar, vanilla bean, and figs to the pot. Cover and bring to a full boil over medium heat. (Don't worry; it may look dry.) Stir the mixture and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lower the heat, and cook uncovered at a full simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the little bubbles to be throughout the pot, not just at the edges. After 45 minutes, refrigerate a small amount of the liquid to see if it becomes syrupy. It should be like a soft fruit preserve. Keep cooking just until the liquid starts to gel when cold. If the liquid is too firm, add a little orange juice or water, cook for a minute, and test it again until it's right. Depending on how ripe the figs are, they will probably keep their shape, but it's fine if they don't. Discard the vanilla bean and serve or refrigerate. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 One 16.5-ounce vanilla-flavored boxed cake mix 
 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 
 1/4 cup key lime juice 
 2 cups cold heavy cream 
 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 
 Cayenne pepper, for garnish 
 Zest from 2 to 3 limes, for garnish 
 Instructions: 
 Special equipment: miniature cupcake liners, squeeze bottle, piping bag and a large star tip Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 3 miniature muffin tins with miniature paper liners. Make the cake mix according to the package directions. Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each about halfway full (about 2 teaspoons each). Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Place the muffin tins onto a cooling rack and cool completely. Meanwhile, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk and key lime juice. Pour the mixture into a small squeeze bottle. Put the heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in a large mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to whip to medium-stiff peaks. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Alternatively, if you do not have a piping bag with a star tip, you can put the whipped cream into a large resealable bag and cut a corner of the bag to create your own piping bag. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble, place the tip of the squeeze bottle into the center of one cupcake. Press the tip about three-quarters of the way into the cupcake and squeeze a small amount of the key lime filling into the cupcake (the filling should just come to the top of the cupcake). Repeat this step with the remaining cupcakes. Pipe small mounds of the whipped cream on top of each cupcake. Garnish each cupcake with a light dusting of cayenne pepper and a sprinkle of lime zest. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup whole milk 
 Finely grated zest of 1 large lemon 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 4 egg yolks 
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1 cup sugar 
 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 
 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon) 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, chilled 
 12 amaretti or 1 1/2-inch diameter vanilla cookies 
 1/2 cup sliced almonds 
 Instructions: 
 For the custard: In a small saucepan, bring the milk and lemon zest to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour and egg yolks (the mixture will be thick). Pour the milk mixture into the bowl, whisking until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan and whisk slowly and constantly over medium-low heat until smooth and thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Whisk in the lemon juice and vanilla until smooth. Transfer the custard to a clean bowl and lay a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate for 2 hours. For the meringue: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Let the syrup cool for 1 minute. While the sugar mixture is cooking, in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to high and beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks. Reduce the speed to low and carefully drizzle the hot syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Beat at high speed until the egg whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the lemon juice. Fold the custard into the meringue, then spoon into serving bowls or cups. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. For the topping: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. In a food processor, blend together the flour, brown sugar and butter until the mixture begins to form into clumps, about 20 seconds. Add the cookies and pulse until the cookies are crushed into 1/4-to-1/2-inch pieces. Pulse in the almonds until combined. Arrange the mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the almonds begin to brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the topping over the meringue custard and serve. Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method. <|endoftext|>

 1/2 cup pure olive oil 
 1 head purple cabbage, finely shredded 
 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced 
 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves 
 Hamburger buns, for serving 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Special equipment: lump charcoal, wood chips soaked in water for 15 minutes, smoker or charcoal grill For the Dry Rub: Add all the dry rub ingredients into a medium-sized bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. For the pork shoulder: Place the pork, fat side up, on a clean baking sheet. Season the pork on all sides with salt and pepper then rub the dry rub all over the pork, pressing into the meat. Cover the pork with plastic wrap and place into the refrigerator for 7 hours. Black Pepper Vinegar Sauce: Place all the ingredients into a blender and blend until emulsified. Add water if the sauce is too thick. Green Onion Slaw: Place the green onions, vinegar, chiles, mayonnaise, salt, pepper and oil into a blender and blend until emulsified. Place the cabbage and red onions in a bowl, add the dressing and stir until combined. Fold in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste. For the pork shoulder: Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking. Following manufacturer's instructions and using lump charcoal and 1/2 cup drained wood chips for a smoker, or 1 cup for a barbecue, start fire and bring temperature of smoker or barbecue to 225 degrees F to 250 degrees F. Place the pork on the rack in smoker or barbecue. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork reaches 165 degrees F. Turn pork every 45 minutes, about 6 hours total. If using the smoker, after 2 hours place the pork into the smoker pan and fill halfway with chicken stock. (This is to prevent the shoulder from drying out.) Add more charcoal, as needed, to maintain 225 degrees F to 250 degrees F and more wood drained wood chips (1/2 cup for the smoker or 1 cup for the barbecue with each addition) to maintain smoke level. Transfer pork to a clean rimmed baking sheet. Let stand until cool enough to handle. Shred into bite-size pieces. Mound on platter and toss with most of the Black Pepper Vinegar Sauce, reserving the rest for drizzling the bun. Pour any juice from the baking sheet over the pork. For assembly: Drizzle the sauce on the top and bottom of the bun. Top the bottom bun with the meat, another drizzle of sauce, Green Onion Slaw and finish with the top of the bun. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 3 cups stale French bread, cut in 3/4-inch cubes 
 2 cups milk 
 2 eggs 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 
 4 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly cooled 
 1/2 cup sultana raisins 
 2 egg yolks 
 1 stick butter, not margarine 
 1 cup sugar 
 1/3 cup bourbon whiskey, to taste 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place stale bread in a bowl with milk and squeeze the bread with your hand until well saturated with milk. With an electric mixer on high speed in a separate bowl, beat eggs with sugar until thick and pale. Stir in the vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter and raisins to the egg mixture. Add the soaked bread crumbs to the egg mixture and stir well. Let stand for 10 minutes. It is important to allow enough time for the bread to absorb the egg mixture or the bread crumbs will float to the top during baking, leaving a layer of custard on the bottom of the dish. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Bake until firm, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 45 to 50 minutes. Let it slightly cool in the dish. Meanwhile, near the end of the baking time, make the sauce. With an electric mixer, beat egg yolks until thick and pale. In a saucepan, melt the butter and sugar. Pour the butter and sugar mixture over the egg yolks, beating constantly with the mixer, until well thickened. Stir in bourbon by hand. Serve the pudding warm with vanilla ice cream if desired. Pass the hot bourbon sauce separately. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 1/2 pound flank steak 
 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 Ground black pepper 
 1 cup balsamic vinegar 
 2 tablespoons butter 
 Instructions: 
 Trim steak of excess fat. Rub steak with garlic and pepper. Place steak into a glass baking dish and pour vinegar over steak. Marinate steak for 20-30 minutes, turning the steak every 10 minutes. Remove steak from marinade and pat dry with paper towel. Grill or broil steak to desired degree of doneness. Pour marinade into a saucepan and simmer over medium high heat until the liquid is syrupy. Add 2 tablespoons cold butter to syrup and swirl to melt butter. Slice steak across the grain in thin slices and serve with balsamic sauce <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 2 pounds fresh cream cheese, at room temperature 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract 
 1 teaspoon nutmeg 
 1 3/4 cups sugar 
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
 4 eggs 
 1/3 cup graham cracker crumbs (pulse whole graham crackers in a food processor) 
 Instructions: 
 Thickly brush a 9-inch springform pan with 1/2 of the melted butter and place in the freezer to harden, about 10 minutes. When hard, repeat to make a thick coating of butter. Adjust your oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), beat the cream cheese until fluffy and very smooth. Beat in the extracts, nutmeg, sugar, and salt. One at a time, add the eggs, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan and place the pan on a double-layer sheet of aluminum foil, with at least 3 inches of foil all around the pan. Fold the aluminum foil up around the sides of the pan. Fill a roasting pan large enough to hold the cake pan with hot water to a depth of about 1-inch, then lift the foil-wrapped cake into the roasting pan, keeping the foil turned up so that it prevents water from overflowing or seeping into the cake. The foil should not be closed over the top of the cake. Be careful not to tear any holes in the foil! Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and dry to the touch, though still a bit soft in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. It should "shimmy" a bit when you shake the pan; it will firm up more as it cools. Remove the pan from the water bath, remove the foil, and let cool at room temperature 15 minutes. Refrigerate, uncovered, 2 hours before removing the cake from the pan. To remove the cake from the pan, first remove the sides. Cover the surface with plastic wrap. Place a large plate over the cake, then flip the cake over and onto the plate, tapping if necessary to help the cake come away from the pan bottom. If tapping doesn't do the trick, try a blow torch or stove burner to warm the bottom of the pan to loosen it. Remove the pan bottom and evenly sprinkle the exposed surface with graham cracker crumbs. Place a serving plate over the crumbs and flip the cake again so that the crumbs form the bottom crust and the top is covered with plastic. Refrigerate, lightly covered, at least 3 hours or overnight before serving. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 4 bone-in chicken breasts with skin (6 ounces each) 
 Salt and freshly ground pepper 
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
 1 medium carrot, chopped 
 1/2 cup chopped onions 
 2 cups brown veal stock 
 2 cups sliced button mushrooms 
 2 shallots, minced 
 2 tablespoons cognac 
 1/2 cup dry white wine 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 F. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Warm 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Carefully, lay the chicken breasts, skin side down, in the pan. Sear for 3 minutes, or until the skin has nicely browned. Transfer the chicken, skin side up, to a nonstick jelly-roll pan. Reserve the saute pan. Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a knife. While the chicken is cooking, remove most of the fat from the saute pan. Add the carrots and onions to the pan. Saute over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to caramelize. Add the stock and raise the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. Strain through a fine sieve into a small bowl; skim off any fat that rises to the surface. Warm the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots. Saute for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are golden. Season with the salt. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cognac. Carefully ignite the cognac with a long match. Allow the flame to burn out, then add the wine. Return the pan to the heat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the reserved stock and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the tarragon. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Remove the skin from the chicken breasts. Carefully cut the breast meat from the breast bone and then cut each breast, on the diagonal, into 2 pieces. Place a divided chicken in the center of each of 4 warm dinner plates. <|endoftext|>

Remove from the heat and whisk in the vinegar, citrus juices and zest, and the coriander. Return to medium heat and boil until thick, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter; keep warm. Season the scallops on one side with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the scallops seasoned-side down and sear until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and divide among plates. Top with the scallops, drizzle with the citrus sauce and sprinkle with the parsley. Photograph by Antonis Achilleos <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 2 pounds chicken wings 
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 2 teaspoons paprika 
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper 
 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme 
 1 cup beer (not dark) 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 Vegetable oil for deep-frying 
 Parsley sprigs for garnish 
 Apricot Mustard Sauce (see below) 
 Blue Cheese Dressing (see below) 
 1/2 cup apricot preserves 
 2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard 
 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
 1/4 cup olive oil 
 1 tablespoon heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese 
 A few drops of fresh lemon juice 
 Instructions: 
 Cut off the wing tips. Halve wings at joint. Separate the "drumstick," or first-joint, pieces (the thick ones) from the second-joint pieces. Beginning at the narrower end of each "drumstick," with a sharp knife cut the tendons and, holding the exposed end of the bone with a kitchen towel, scrape the skin and meat down the bone as far as possible toward the thicker end to make a plump drumstick shape. Cut through the cartilage at one end of each second-joint piece, separating the bones, scrape the skin and meat down the larger bone to make a plump drumstick shape, and pull out and discard the smaller bone. Arrange all of the "drumsticks" in a shallow dish, sprinkle them with the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste, and let them marinate, covered and chilled, for 1 hour. Make the batter while the chicken is marinating: In a bowl whisk together the flour, the salt, the paprika, the cumin, the pepper, the thyme, and the cayenne and make a well in the center. Add the beer and the oil in a stream, and whisk the batter until it is smooth. Let the batter stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Stir the batter before using it. In a large deep fryer or large deep kettle heat 2 inches of the oil to 375 degrees on a deep fat thermometer. Dip the chicken in the batter and fry in oil, 5 pieces at a time, turning it, for 3 minutes, or until it is cooked through and golden. Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon as it is fried to paper towels to drain and make sure the oil returns to 375 degrees before adding each new batch. Sprinkle the drumsticks with salt to taste, arrange them on a platter, and garnish the platter with the parsley sprigs. Force the preserves through a fine sieve into a small bowl and stir in the mustard. Transfer the sauce to a portable container and serve at room temperature. In a bowl combine the vinegar with salt and pepper to taste, add the oil and the cream in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Stir in the blue cheese and the lemon juice. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 
 Kosher salt 
 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced 
 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening (recommended: Crisco) 
 1/4 cup ice water 
 4 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature 
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
 Lemon Filling, recipe follows 
 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
 1 1/2 cups sugar 
 4 extra-large eggs 
 3 extra-large egg yolks (save the whites for the meringue) 
 1/4 cup finely grated lemon zest (6 to 8 lemons) 
 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 
 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 
 Instructions: 
 Combine the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Put the flour mixture in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and shortening and pulse about 10 times until the butter is in small bits. Add the ice water and process until the dough comes together. Dump on a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough and fit into a 9-inch tart pan with removable sides. Don't stretch the dough when placing it in the pan or it will shrink during baking. Cut off the excess by rolling the pin across the top of the pan. Line the tart shell with a piece of buttered aluminum foil, butter side down, and fill it with dried beans or rice. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and prick the bottom of the shell all over with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. For the meringue, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until frothy. With the mixer still running, slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and beat until the meringue is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Immediately spread the lemon filling in the cooled tart shell and pipe the meringue over it with a large star tip. Be sure the meringue covers the entire top and touches the edges of the shell, to prevent it from shrinking. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes, until the meringue is lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. On low speed, add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, and then add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt. Don't worry; it will look curdled. Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until thick, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Whisk briskly when it starts to thicken and cook over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Don't allow it to boil! It will be 175 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Pour into a bowl and cool to room temperature. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1 whole chicken, 3 pounds 
 1 gallon cool water 
 2 carrots, cut in 2-inch pieces 
 2 celery stalks, cut in 2-inch pieces 
 1 onion, halved 
 1 head garlic, halved horizontally 
 2 turnips, halved 
 4 fresh thyme sprigs 
 2 fresh rosemary sprigs 
 1 bay leaf 
 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 3 carrots, cut in 1/2-inch circles 
 1 bag frozen or fresh pearl onions, see note 
 1 box frozen or fresh peas, see note 
 Leaves from 4 fresh parsley sprigs 
 2 frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed 
 1 egg mixed with 3 tablespoons water 
 1/4 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Put the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with 1 gallon of cool water. Add the vegetables and herbs and bring the pot up to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim well; then simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, skimming frequently as the oil rises to the surface. What we're doing here is not only cooking the chicken but also creating the base sauce for the pot pie. Remove the chicken to a platter to cool. Continue to cook down the chicken broth for another 15 minutes to condense the flavor; you should have about 8 cups when you're finished. Using a colander, strain the chicken broth into another pot and discard the solids. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and bones. Wipe out the stockpot and put it back on the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour to form a paste. This is a roux, which will act as a thickener. Now, gradually pour in 8 cups of the chicken broth, whisking the entire time to prevent lumps. Whisk and simmer for 10 minutes to cook out the starchy taste of the flour and thicken the broth; it should look like cream of chicken soup. Season with salt and pepper. Fold in the shredded chicken, carrots, pearl onions, peas, and parsley. Stir to combine and turn off the heat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the thawed puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured, cool surface. Invert individual crocks on the pastry sheet and, using a sharp knife, cut circles around the outside of the bowls, slightly larger than the bowl itself. Fill the crocks 3/4 of the way with the chicken mixture, making sure each serving has a nice amount of chicken, vegetables, and broth. Carefully cap each crock with a pastry circle, pressing the dough around the rim to form a seal. Lightly beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush some on the pastry. Sprinkle the pastry with the Parmigiano. Set the crocks on a cookie sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, until puffed and golden. Notes: If using fresh pearl onions, blanch for 2 minutes in salted boiling water; then pinch the skins off -- if using frozen, run under cool water for 2 minutes to thaw. If using fresh peas, blanch for 2 minutes in salted boiling water--if using frozen, run under cool water for 2 minutes to thaw. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted, plus 2 tablespoons 
 1 cup stone ground yellow cornmeal 
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 cup milk 
 1/2 cup buttermilk 
 1 egg 
 8 ounces pepper Jack cheese, shredded 
 1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed 
 1/2 cup diced and seeded roasted poblano peppers 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on the stovetop over medium heat.

 Ingredients: 
 1 cup white wine 
 60 littleneck clams 
 8 thin slices bacon 
 2 cups toasted bread crumbs 
 1 stick butter, melted 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 
 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan 
 1 tablespoon salt 
 2 jalapenos, minced 
 1 red pepper, minced 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the white wine and the clams in a wide pot with a lid over medium heat. Allow the clams to steam until they open, approximately 10 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Remove the clams from the pot and once they are cool enough to work with, remove the meat from the shells. Tear the shells in half and move the meat to 1 side of the shell and discard the other. Place the thinly sliced bacon on a sheet pan and bake until crispy. When they are cooled, crumble the slices individually between both hands, or chop them until they are in fine pieces. See Cook's Note 1. Preheat the broiler. In a medium sized bowl, mix the bacon and all the remaining ingredients and check for seasoning. Liberally top each clam with the bread crumb mixture and place them under a broiler until golden brown. See Cook's Note 2. Serve the clams warm. Cook's Note 1: If you want a little extra flavor, save the drippings and add them in with the topping. Cook's Note 2: Placing the clams on a bed of large granules of salt will help keep them steady in their shells while cooking. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 tomatillos, husked, washed, and cut into 1/4inch dice 
 2 green onions, white and some green part, thinly sliced on the diagonal 
 1 small bunch cilantro, leaves only, coarsely chopped 
 1 teaspoon minced seeded jalapeno chile 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 16 beef marrow (leg) bones (about 4 pounds), approximately 2 inches long 
 6 large Corn Tortillas (recipe attached) 
 Vegetable oil for frying 
 1 ripe avocado, peeled and diced, for serving 
 1 teaspoon flaked sea salt 
 Instructions: 
 In a glass or ceramic bowl, combine the tomatillos, green onions, cilantro, jalapeno, salt, pepper, and lime juice. Toss to mix, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours so that the flavors can marry. Return the salsa to room temperature before using. Dig the marrow out of the bones with a small sharp knife, scraping against the bone to get all of it, or push it out with your fingers if it will come out in one piece. Dip the knife into very hot water and cut the marrow into 1/4inch dice, dipping again as necessary. Refrigerate the marrow until you are ready to use it. Pour oil to a depth of 1/2-inch in a small skillet. Fry the tortillas on both sides until crisp and golden. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a low oven. Bring a large skillet of lightly salted water to a slow simmer. Remove from the heat and immediately plunge all of the marrow into the hot water. Leave in the water for 1 minute, then use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a warm plate, draining well. Place a warm tostada on a warm plate and top with some of the salsa. Top each tostada with a spoonful of the warm marrow and scatter a few grains of the sea salt over the marrow. Add a few cubes of avocado, season with pepper to taste and serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 6 limes 
 1/2 cup water 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 4 cups watermelon pieces, seeds removed 
 1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 40 currants 
 2 empty ice-cube trays 
 Instructions: 
 Warm the limes in the microwave for 30 seconds to slightly soften them (this will make them easier to juice). Cut a thin slice off each end of the limes to make a flat base for each half to rest on. Cut the limes in half and squeeze out the juice into a medium bowl. Using a teaspoon or grapefruit spoon, scrape the remaining pulp and membranes out of the lime halves to make cups (discard the pulp). Transfer the cups to a plastic bag and refrigerate until ready to fill. Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Set aside to cool. Puree the watermelon cubes in a food processor or blender, then strain through a coarse strainer into the bowl containing the lime juice. Stir in the vanilla extract and cooled sugar syrup. Pour into ice cube trays and freeze overnight. When ready to serve, turn the watermelon ice cubes into a food processor fitted with a metal blade or a powerful blender. Pulse the machine until the granita has the texture of crushed ice. Fill the lime halves very full with the granita, rounding the tops. Dot with the currants, making them look like watermelon seeds. Serve immediately. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan 
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan 
 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
 1/2 cup plain malted milk powder (such as Carnation) 
 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for topping 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
 4 large eggs, separated 
 1/2 cup milk 
 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 
 For the frosting: 
 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 1 large egg plus 5 egg yolks 
 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 
 2 tablespoons plain malted milk powder 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 
 Instructions: 
 Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the malted milk powder, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar; continue beating until stiff shiny peaks form. Set aside. Beat the vegetable oil, egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl with the mixer on medium speed (no need to clean the beaters). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until incorporated. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and springs back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar and spread a large clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) on top. Invert a cooling rack onto the towel, then invert the cake onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Roll up the cake and towel together, starting from a long side to form a 17-inch-long roll. (You'll remove the towel later.) Set aside on the rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Combine the granulated sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. (Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush.) When the sugar has almost reached 240 degrees F, beat the egg and egg yolks in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the sugar syrup between the whisk and the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the bowl is cool to the touch. Remove the whisk and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add the butter and beat until thick and glossy. Combine the malted milk powder, vanilla and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl; beat into the frosting along with the nutmeg. Unroll the cooled cake and spread with 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Gently reroll the cake (without the towel) and trim the ends. Cover with the remaining frosting; dust with cocoa powder. Photograph by Johnny Miller <|endoftext|>

 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped 
 1 1/2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce 
 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 
 2 tablespoons water 
 6 green onions, green and pale green part, thinly sliced 
 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 
 1 (12-ounce) can cola soda (recommended: Coke) 
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 
 2 tablespoons sesame oil 
 8 cloves garlic, chopped 
 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro 
 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 
 1 1/2 pound pork shoulder steak, no more than 3/4-inch thick, not trimmed 
 Boston lettuce leaves 
 Kojuchang Sauce 
 2 tablespoons kochujang 
 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon sesame oil 
 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds 
 2 teaspoons honey 
 2 green onions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise 
 Instructions: 
 Watch how to make this recipe. For the kimchi: Put the cabbage in a large bowl, toss with the salt and let stand, tossing occasionally, about 2 hours. Rinse the cabbage well, then drain and squeeze out the excess water with your hands. Transfer to a large clean bowl. Combine the garlic, serrano, ginger, fish sauce, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of water in a food processor and process until smooth. Pour over the cabbage, add the green onion and sesame seeds and toss to combine. Cover and let marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour, stirring a few times. For the pork: Whisk together the cola, soy, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, cilantro and black pepper in a large baking dish until combined. Add the pork steak and turn to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Heat the grill to high. Remove the pork steak from the marinade 30 minutes before grilling to take the chill off. Grill the steak until golden brown, charred on both sides, cooked to medium doneness, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 150 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and let rest, loosely tented with foil for 10 minutes. Cut against the grain into thin strips. Fill lettuce leaves with some of the pork, a drizzle of the sauce and top with the kimchi. Arrange on a serving platter and serve. For the sauce: Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl. <|endoftext|> 
 
 Ingredients: 
 1-ounce fresh yeast or 2 envelopes active dry yeast 
 2 cups whole milk, lukewarm 
 1 tablespoon sugar, plus 1 teaspoon 
 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 
 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1/3 cup, plus more for drizzling 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves 
 1 cup red grapes, halved or quartered 
 1 cup golden raisins 
 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1 tablespoon lemon zest, grated 
 Gray salt 
 1 egg, beaten well 
 Instructions: 
 In a large bowl or the work bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 cup of the flour. Mix well, cover bowl with tea towel and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate. Place risen dough in mixer, set aside. Take a large saute pan and heat it dry over medium-high heat. Pour in 1 cup of the olive oil and add rosemary. Add grapes, and raisins, mix together and allow to cool. Begin to mix the dough, slowly, and mix another 4 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment, then add a pinch of gray salt. Add half of the olive oil/grape mixture into dough. Knead until smooth with hands. Form the dough into a ball. Place some olive oil in large bowl to coat the sides. Place dough ball into bowl, and cover with tea towel. Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in refrigerator until doubled in bulk about 45 minutes, or up to overnight for a fuller rise. The next day, take the risen dough, and place in mixing bowl. With more olive oil from the grape/raisin mixture, press dough down into a flat disk with the heel of your hand. Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle. The dough can be rolled but the pressure will produce heavier bread. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil. Cover with tea towel, and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes. To bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake 15 minutes then remove from the oven and brush with the egg. Sprinkle with the remaining grape mixture then the remaining sugar. Top with lemon zest and finish with some coarse salt. Return to the oven and continue to bake until golden brown on top and crisp on the bottom, about 7 or 8 minutes. Let cool in the pan before cutting. <|endoftext|>

 Ingredients: 
 4 large plum tomatoes 
 Salt and sugar 
 1 1/2 pounds zucchini 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 3 shallots, sliced 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 3 tablespoons fresh parsley 
 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme 
 1/2 pound grated Gruyere 
 Instructions: 
 Preheat the broiler. Cut the tomatoes in 1/2 crosswise. Scoop out the centers leaving the outer thick flesh intact. Sprinkle the interior shells of the tomatoes with a couple pinches of salt and sugar, and invert them on a paper towel lined plate to drain until ready to stuff. With the grating attachment of a food processor or on the large-holed side of a box grater, grate the zucchini, and place it in a strainer. Toss the zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt and place the strainer over a bowl to catch the juices. Allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes. In a large heavy skillet, saute the shallots in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until they begin to caramelize. Meanwhile squeeze the zucchini to release as much water as possible. Turn the heat up on the shallots, add the dry zucchini to the pan, and saute the zucchini with the shallots for 5 minutes. Add chopped parsley and thyme, and then toss the zucchini with the cheese, reserving 1/4 cup of the cheese for topping. Stuff the tomatoes with the filling, mounding it slightly, and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Place in tomato halves in ovenproof baking dish and broil them until the tops are golden.

 Ingredients: 
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 2 medium cloves garlic, crushed 
 1 medium shallot, very finely chopped 
 1 medium red bell pepper, seeded, deveined, and cut into very thin slices 
 1 medium yellow bell pepper, seeded, deveined, and cut into very thin slices 
 1 medium orange bell pepper, seeded, deveined, and cut into very thin slices 
 Pinch crushed red-pepper flakes 
 Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 
 10 fresh basil leaves, well washed and dried, coarsely torn 
 Pepper Pasta, recipe follows 
 Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving 
 1 large red, yellow, or orange bell pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
 3 large eggs 
 Coarse salt 
 Instructions: 
 Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in shallot, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add bell peppers and red pepper flakes, and season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring until soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in 1/2 of the basil. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, and add to the pan with peppers. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Transfer to serving platter. If desired, remove garlic, and discard. Garnish with remaining basil and Parmesan. Serve immediately. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Rub outside of pepper with olive oil, and place on a small baking sheet. Cook until skin begins to bubble and turn lightly brown in spots, 20 to 25 minutes, turning once after 10 minutes. Transfer to a container with a tight-fitting lid to steam for about 15 minutes. Remove stem and seeds; peel away skin, and discard. In the bowl of a food processor, puree pepper (there should be a generous 1/2 cup puree). Add flour and eggs. Process until dough forms a ball, about 15 seconds. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover with an inverted bowl or plastic wrap, and let rest 1 1/2 hours at room temperature or refrigerate overnight. Divide dough into 8 pieces. Working with a few pieces at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered, flatten each portion of dough into a disk shape somewhat narrower than the machine's opening. Very lightly dust dough with flour. Feed through at machine's widest setting. (If dough pulls or tears when passing through machine, simply sprinkle a little more flour over dough, just before it's fed, to keep it from sticking. When finished, remove excess flour with a dry pastry brush.) As pasta sheet emerges, gently support it with palm, and guide it onto work surface. Fold sheet in half. Pass through a second time on the same setting to smooth dough and increase its elasticity. Thin dough by passing it through ever-finer settings, 2 passes on each setting, until sheets are almost translucent but do not tear. Pass the dough dthrdough until it has been passed through settings 1 through 4 (machine settings differ?some have as many as 10, while others have only 6). Switch to the cutter attachment, and pass each sheet through fettuccini cutter. Separate strands, and hang on a pasta rack to dry so that they do not stick together. Yield: about 1 1/2 pounds <|endoftext|>
